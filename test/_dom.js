/* ============================================================
   The shared DOM double for the browser-layer tests.

   Eight test files each grew their own `class FakeElement extends EventTarget`
   — hud, hudSelection, observer, overlays, saveload, starmap, techChart,
   update — plus four copies of the same no-op-Proxy `fakeCtx()` and eight
   copies of a byte-identical `fakeDocument()`. They were ~90% the same code,
   and the 10% that differed was not a considered difference: it was whichever
   subset of the DOM the file that copied it happened to need that week. So
   overlays' copy grew real `.remove()` parent tracking and hudSelection's did
   not; hud's grew a real `querySelector` that walks the tree and update's kept
   the always-null stub; observer's `getBoundingClientRect` returned a real
   800x600 box and saveload's returned zeros. A test written against a weak
   copy silently asserts less than the same test written against a strong one,
   and nothing tells you which copy you landed on.

   This is the union, with the strongest implementation of each member — real
   child arrays, real per-instance class state, real parent tracking so
   `.remove()` splices, and a real (if shallow) `querySelector` — so every file
   starts from the best version rather than the weakest.

   TWO THINGS ARE DELIBERATELY CONFIGURABLE, because making them uniform would
   change what the code under test actually does:

   • `context` — what `getContext()` hands back. dom.js calls
     `.getContext("2d")` on the canvas handles at module scope no matter what
     the test is about, so it always has to succeed. Returning null (the
     default) leaves modules that guard `if (!ctx) return` inert; returning
     `fakeCtx()` lets them run all the way through. Files whose subject
     actually draws (render.js's spriteIcon reads `canvas.toDataURL()` back,
     and its own catch fires a console.error on EVERY icon button of EVERY
     render if either half fails) pass `{ context: fakeCtx }`.
   • `clientWidth` / `clientHeight` — the viewport `getBoundingClientRect`
     reports. Camera and pointer-mapping code divides by these, so zeros and
     800x600 are genuinely different test fixtures, not a detail.

   USAGE — dom.js resolves every element handle exactly ONCE, at import time,
   via `doc.getElementById(id)`, so the document has to exist BEFORE anything
   that transitively imports dom.js is first imported. Under `node --test`'s
   native ESM loader that means installFakeDom() at the top of the file and
   `await import(...)` for the modules under test, never a static import:

       import { installFakeDom, fakeCtx } from "./_dom.js";
       installFakeDom({ context: fakeCtx });
       const { renderSelectionPanel } = await import("../hudSelection.js");
