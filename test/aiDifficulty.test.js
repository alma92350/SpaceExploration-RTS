/* ============================================================
   AI DIFFICULTY (engine/aiDifficulty.js): the Easy/Medium/Hard pick from the splash
   screen, orthogonal to the archetype and the player-picked strategy — see the
   module header for the full design. Tier 0 (scaffold: state.ai.difficulty,
   difficultyFor, round-trip) and Tier 1 (worker target, war patience, the seeded
   economic edge) both land here. Tier 2 (AI-only research pace) is table-shape-only
   here — its actual behavioral coverage lives in test/techtree.test.js, alongside
   updateResearch/researchTimeScale, which it composes with. Tier 3 (market barter)
   is the same split: the gating tests are here, aiBarter's own mechanism is covered
   in test/market.test.js alongside sell/buy, which it composes with.
