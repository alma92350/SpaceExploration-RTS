/* ============================================================
   A GOLDEN LOCK on the whole selection panel.

   rebuildSelectionPanel is 845 lines and ~28 independent "is one of THESE
   selected?" blocks, appended to panelEl in a fixed order. test/hudSelection.
   test.js covers a lot of what those blocks DECIDE — a disabled button stays
   inert, the live-patch path reuses nodes, the lane rows read the right
   commodity — but nothing covers the panel's SHAPE: which rows exist, in what
   order, with which classes and text. That is exactly the property a
   decomposition has to preserve and exactly the one a behavioural test cannot
   see, because every such test looks up the one row it cares about by class or
   text prefix and is blind to a row that moved, vanished, or grew a sibling.

   So: build the panel for a spread of selections, serialize the tree the code
   actually produced, and compare it against a recorded snapshot. A refactor
   that only moves code passes untouched; one that drops a row or reorders two
   fails loudly, naming the fixture.

   The snapshot is DATA, not a claim about what is right — it records what the
   panel does today. When a change to the UI is intended, regenerate it and
   READ THE DIFF; that diff is the review artifact, and it is the whole point:

       UPDATE_PANEL_GOLDEN=1 node --test test/hudSelection-golden.test.js

   Kept in its own file rather than added to test/hudSelection.test.js because
   the two answer different questions and fail for different reasons: that file
   tells you a behaviour broke, this one tells you the output moved.
