/* ============================================================
   hudSelection.js builds the whole selection panel with direct DOM calls
   (document.createElement / panelEl.appendChild / classList / …) and exports
   exactly two functions — renderSelectionPanel() and resetSelectionSignature()
   — everything else (makeButton, the signature guard, every sub-panel
   renderer) is module-private. So the only way to exercise any of it is to
   give it a `document` that behaves enough like the real one, drive it
   through renderSelectionPanel(), and inspect the fake tree it built.

   dom.js resolves every element handle ONCE, at import time, via
   doc.getElementById(id) (doc = typeof document !== "undefined" ? document :
   null — dom.js:16-17). So globalThis.document has to exist BEFORE
   hudSelection.js (or anything that transitively imports dom.js) is first
   imported — under `node --test`'s native ESM loader that means a dynamic
   import() after the stub is installed, not a static one. See
   test/saveload.test.js:1-46 for the identical constraint on saveload.js's
   import graph, which that comment confirms already includes hudSelection.js
   and traces the graph for unguarded module-scope DOM access.

   That file's stubEl() clears the "don't throw at import time" bar (every
   module-scope .addEventListener call it needs to survive — hud.js:31-32,
   boot.js:68 — succeeds against a no-op), but it hands back the SAME inert
   object for every id and hardcodes classList.contains to false. Useless
   here: TARGET 1 needs to read back one SPECIFIC button's real classList,
   and TARGET 2 needs to compare SPECIFIC node references across two renders.
   The shared harness in test/_dom.js tracks real per-instance class state and
   a real children array instead, and — being a real EventTarget — supports the
   same .addEventListener calls stubEl's no-ops were standing in for. It is
   installed with `context: fakeCtx` because makeButton's sprite icons drive
   render.js's spriteIcon, which draws into a real 2D context and reads
   canvas.toDataURL() back; with a null context its own catch fires a
   console.error on EVERY icon button, of every render, in every test here.

   "<Commodity> · <N> aboard" label — reported against a live save, reproduced by loading it into
