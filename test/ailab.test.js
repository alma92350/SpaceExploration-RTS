/* ============================================================
   Guards for tools/ailab.js — the headless AI bench (see docs/odyssey-ai-review.md).

   The bench exists to answer "did this AI change help?", so the bench itself has to be
   trustworthy in exactly two ways, and these tests pin both:

     1. DETERMINISM. Two runs of the same configuration must produce identical numbers,
        or a "+0.04 improvement" is indistinguishable from noise and the whole loop is
        theatre. The engine is already deterministic; what this guards is that the lab
        (its sparring bots, its sampling cadence, its seed derivation) doesn't smuggle in
        a wall-clock or an unseeded pick.
     2. THE OVERRIDE SEAM. A candidate AI is injected as data into the ARCHETYPES /
        STRATEGIES / DIFFICULTY_OPTIONS tables. If that injection silently no-ops, every
        search result is a measurement of the baseline against itself.

   Runs are short (a few sim-minutes) — this suite guards the harness, not the AI. The
   long soak lives behind `node tools/ailab.js check`, which is a tool you run, not a test
   that runs you: several of its findings fire today on purpose.

/* ---------- SCALE INVARIANCE: the property that keeps this list honest ----------

   Three of these five detectors have had to be rewritten because they fired on a HEALTHY AI that

   2026-08-05 took supply-deadlock and production-stall — docs/odyssey-ai-review.md §2.12). Each
   time it was caught by a human reading a scoreboard and thinking "that world isn't stuck", which
   is not a mechanism you can rely on.

   unambiguously doing well, scale every magnitude in it, and assert the whole list stays silent.
