   coverage by recollection: it says nothing about the NEXT field, and the failure mode it guards

   resets on load — is invisible to `snapshot()` above, which compares a hand-listed subset.

   to be identical. Any field that is written but not read shows up as a diff, automatically, the
   first time someone adds one. docs/code-improvement-tiers.md proposed a declarative {key, ser,
   clean} field table for the same reason; this delivers the property that table was for, without
