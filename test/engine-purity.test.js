// competition.js and competitionWorker.js import tools/duelCore.js and tools/genome.js, and
// playerFingerprint.js imports tools/genome.js — so today three "bench" files run inside a browser
// Worker and decide the outcomes that become persisted Elo ratings. Nothing in engine/ imports
// them, so the fixed-point walk below never reached them: structurally identical code was guarded
// on one side of a directory line and completely unguarded on the other.
//
// Both halves of the guard are the right ones for these files. A Worker has no `document`, so a
// DOM reference is a crash rather than a style violation; and a duel that does not replay
// identically makes every rating derived from it meaningless.
