/* ============================================================
   AI MILITARY (engine/aiMilitary.js) — the offense ramp's real-target guard.

   The living galaxy instantiates every world at galaxy creation, but
   engine/galaxy.js's `addPlanet(..., { unsettled: true })` strips ALL player
   units and buildings from a world the player hasn't reached yet — so a
   background/unvisited neighbour starts with ZERO player footprint. Its own
   diplomacy (engine/diplomacy.js) still drifts toward war on its own —
   scarcity, and past grace, unbounded late-game creep — with no player
   involvement at all. Once hostile, aiOffense's Odyssey branch has, until
   now, mustered and committed a wave regardless: chooseAttackTarget always
   resolves SOME coordinate (the player's charted-but-empty start, or a
   fog-sweep hunt point) even when there is nothing there to fight. That
   wastes the neighbour's whole production line, forever, on a world the
   player may never even visit — and (a real save's data) starves it of the
   surplus it would otherwise bank toward its own economy.

   Written from the requirement, ahead of the fix: an Odyssey neighbour must
   only muster and commit a voluntary wave once the player has SOME real
   footprint on that specific world — a unit or a building, either counts.
   Deliberately NOT fog-gated (unlike visibleEnemyForceCount/counterToPlayerArmy):
   this is "is there anyone there at all", not "can the AI currently see them".
   Skirmish (no state.diplomacy) never reaches the guarded branch, so an
   always-present skirmish player is untouched — see the "no diplomacy"
   coverage in test/diplomacy.test.js.
