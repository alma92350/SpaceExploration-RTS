/* ============================================================
   A guard on the SUITE. CONTRIBUTING.md's hard rules are only "enforced by the test suite"
   for as long as the tests enforcing them keep existing and keep running — and nothing
   checked either. Delete a guard file and CI stays green with a smaller test count nobody
   reads; rely on implicit test-file discovery and a Node upgrade can quietly change what
   gets run. Both are cheap to pin, so pin them.
