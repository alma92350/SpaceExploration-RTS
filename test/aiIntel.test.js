/* ============================================================
   Guards for engine/aiIntel.js — what the AI BELIEVES about its opponent.

   This is the first AI state that can be WRONG (every other read is a fact about the current
   frame), so the properties that matter are not "is the number right" but "is the number honest":

     1. FOG-LIMITED. An unscouted army must not exist as far as the belief is concerned. An
        omniscient read here would be both a cheat and — worse — would delete the scouting
        counter-play the whole design rests on.
     2. "I HAVE SEEN NOTHING" ≠ "I HAVE SEEN AN EMPTY BASE". posture stays null until something is
        actually sighted, and confidence is what separates the two. Collapsing them is how an AI
        ends up confidently raiding into an army it never scouted.
     3. A HIGH-WATER MARK THAT FADES. Only a sighting raises it, only time lowers it — so an army
        stepping out of vision does not erase itself, but five-minute-old intel does decay.
     4. OWNER-PARAMETRIC. Both seats read their own fog and their own enemy. A stray "ai" literal is
        exactly how the two self-play bugs in docs/odyssey-ai-review.md happened.

   The three tests above step `s.time` in ONE hop and call updateIntel ONCE per hop. That is not
   how engine/ai.js drives this module: runAI calls updateIntel every THINK_INTERVAL (1.5 sim
   seconds), so between two sightings it runs dozens of times. A fade that is correct for one call
   and wrong for many passes every assertion above, because they only ever check a DIRECTION
   ("faded > 0 && faded < grown") — and any decay curve at all satisfies that, including one two
   hundred times too steep.

   That is exactly the bug these three tests were written for: updateIntel used to write its faded
   value back and then re-fade it from the same timestamp next cycle, so the decay compounded once
   per think cycle and the documented four-minute fade really emptied in about sixty seconds. So
   these drive it at the production cadence and assert the NUMBER the docs promise.        */
