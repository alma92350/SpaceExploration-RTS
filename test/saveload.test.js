// saveload.js's bottom comment says the `typeof window !== "undefined"` guard around its
// autosave-timer/listener wiring exists "so importing this module under Node (to unit-test its
// pure logic) doesn't start a real autosave timer". In practice, though, saveload.js imports
// boot.js, which imports hud.js — and hud.js has two MODULE-SCOPE calls that aren't null-guarded
// the way every other dom.js handle wired at module scope is:
//
//   hud.js:30   repairBtn.addEventListener("click", ...)
//   hud.js:31   departBtn.addEventListener("click", ...)
//   boot.js:54  underAttackEl.addEventListener("click", ...)
//
// Under plain `node --test` (no `document` global) dom.js resolves every handle to `null` by
// design (see dom.js + test/dom.test.js), so those three unguarded calls throw
// `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'addEventListener')` at IMPORT time —
// before this file's own module body (or its `window` guard) ever runs. That's a real gap in
// the "importing this module under Node ... doesn't [start a timer]" claim, but fixing hud.js /
// boot.js is out of this fix's scope (only dom.js, saveload.js and renderShared.js get new
// tests here). So: shim the minimum fake `document` needed to survive those three specific
// calls, confirmed by tracing the whole saveload.js -> boot.js import graph (render.js,
// minimap.js, camera.js, input.js, effects.js, overlays.js, setup.js, hud.js, hudSelection.js,
// sound.js, the engine/* modules) for any OTHER un-guarded module-scope DOM access — there is
// none. Crucially, `window` is deliberately left undefined, so saveload.js's own
// `typeof window !== "undefined"` guard stays off and no real autosave timer/listener starts —
// preserving exactly the Node-safety the module's comment promises for the functions under
// test below.
//
// The shim below is more capable than the original "survive three addEventListener calls" bar:
// A real EventTarget (Node's is WHATWG-compliant — addEventListener/dispatchEvent behave exactly
// like the browser, see test/input.test.js's own header note on this) plus the handful of extra
// properties/methods this file's later "drive the real Load path" section needs: bootState/
// bootGalaxy (boot.js) call renderHUD() for real at the end of every boot, which cascades into
// hud.js's topbar rebuild and hudSelection.js's selection-panel rebuild — genuine DOM building,
// even though nothing below asserts on any of it. Kept as one class (not per-purpose stubs) so
// every handle dom.js resolves — loadBtn included — is equally capable.

/* ============================================================
   The ⌂ Home confirm during a WATCHED / REPLAYED match (docs/competitions-and-elo.md Phase 5).

   Phase 5 closes the save path for a spectated AI-vs-AI match in two places — hud.js HIDES the
   topbar Save/Load buttons, and saveShape.js's resumableMode refuses to checkpoint one — but the ⌂
   Home button is visible in EVERY mode, so its confirm dialog is the third door to the same place.
   Left on the ordinary skirmish copy it promised something false ("Your progress autosaves — Save &
   Exit checkpoints it now") and offered "Save & Exit" as the default-focused PRIMARY button, where
   clicking it: got false back from autoSave(), fell through to a FILE download of the exhibition
   match (a plain skirmish save that loads back handing the human one entrant's army — the exact
   outcome requestExitObserverMode and resumableMode exist to prevent), flashed "Saved ✓" on the
   button hud.js had just hidden, and did not exit. Same shape as the gauntlet-fixture branch Phase 4
   added right above it, so it's pinned the same way: honest copy, no Save & Exit, a plain Leave.
   ============================================================ */
