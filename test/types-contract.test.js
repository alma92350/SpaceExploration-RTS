   Keeps engine/types.js honest about the shapes it claims to describe.

   CONTRIBUTING.md: "When you add or rename a field on a core shape, update its @typedef in
   engine/types.js in the same change." That rule was broken repeatedly and silently — twenty
   fields across seven typedefs had drifted out of the model, including State.playerAi, the
   central field of the self-play feature, omitted by the very commit that added it.

   Nothing caught it because the drift is INVISIBLE to the type checker: every factory assigns
   to a `const` before returning, so TypeScript never runs an excess-property check, and
   `checkJs` is off for files without the pragma. Worse, drift actively BLOCKS type adoption —
   annotating one function in engine/supply.js with @param {State} produced three errors in
   correct code, which teaches contributors that the checker is wrong.

   So this compares the declared @property names against the keys the factories ACTUALLY
   construct, at runtime. Runtime keys, not a text parse of the literal: it can't be fooled by
   formatting, and it is exactly the set a `// @ts-check`ed caller will try to read.

   THE SAME CONTRACT, FOR THE COMPETITION SHAPES

   The five cases above cover engine/types.js's `@typedef {Object}` + `@property` blocks. The
   competition stack writes its typedefs the other way — inline `@typedef {{ a: X, b: Y }} Name`,
   in competitionLedger.js rather than engine/types.js — so none of them were checked by anything,
   and RosterEntry drifted exactly the way State.playerAi once did: addRosterEntry grew a `genome`
   field that the typedef never declared. That is not a hypothetical. It is what turned
   `npm run typecheck` red for two days and merged to main twice, because the only thing that could
   see it was tsc, running in CI, on a build everyone had stopped reading.

   These shapes deserve the guard MORE than GalaxySettings does, not less: a roster entry and a
   ledger are user-facing data that gets persisted to localStorage, exported to a file, and
   imported back from an untrusted one.
