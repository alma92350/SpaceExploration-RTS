   hud.js's endgame clock (docs/improvement-proposals.md "Make the clock endgame visible, honest,
   and configurable"): inside the final 5 minutes of a skirmish's score-decision clock, renderHUD
   flips #matchClock from elapsed time to a countdown and shows a compact two-sided score bar
   (playerScore(state,"player"/"ai")) — the score is otherwise completely invisible in-game, per
   the proposal's own Problem statement.

   renderHUD has no dedicated test file today. The DOM setup is the shared harness in
   test/_dom.js (see its header for why each piece exists, and test/hudSelection.test.js's for
   the full empirical trace of the import-order constraint). hud.js imports hudSelection.js
   directly (renderSelectionPanel), so the exact same transitive graph (render.js, boot.js,
   engine/*, …) has to import cleanly under Node. `context: fakeCtx` because renderSelectionPanel's
   icon buttons run render.js's spriteIcon, which needs a live 2D context and a toDataURL.

   while the sim itself is gated off, never advances it), and shows each topbar resource span's
