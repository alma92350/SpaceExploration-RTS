/* ============================================================
   AI STRATEGY — a player-picked overlay, orthogonal to the archetype
   (engine/aiArchetypes.js). The archetype comes from the world/opponent and
   sets FLAVOR: faction, unit mix, which doctrine it researches. Strategy sets
   AGGRESSION: whether and when the AI voluntarily attacks, how big a standing
   army it bothers to keep, and how it reacts to being attacked. Picked once at
   setup (setup.js "AI Strategy" row) alongside difficulty, and applies in BOTH
   skirmish and Odyssey — see engine/ai.js (aiContext.strategy), engine/
   aiMilitary.js (offense timing), engine/aiEconomy.js (standing-army throttle),
   engine/aiIndustry.js (Helium Bomb) and engine/diplomacy.js (Odyssey grace).

   "default" carries no overrides at all, so a match that never picks a
   strategy — every save/test predating this feature, and the legacy call
   sites that still don't pass one — plays exactly as before: every field
   below is read with a `|| 1` (multipliers) or falsy-default (flags), so an
   absent strategy or an absent field is always a no-op.

   Multipliers COMPOSE with the archetype's own numbers rather than replacing
   them, the same way the archetype's own Odyssey overlay composes with its
   skirmish base (aiArchetypes.js) — so "an Aggressive Rusher" is even more
   aggressive than either alone, and "an Economic Economist" out-turtles a
   default one, instead of every archetype flattening into one strategy's
   numbers.
