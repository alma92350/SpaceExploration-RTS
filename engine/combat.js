/* ============================================================
   Combat-role units (Skiff, Bastion): auto-acquire the nearest enemy
   within aggro range, close to weapon range, and fire on cooldown. An
   explicit 'attack' order pins the target; 'attack-move' auto-engages
   anything encountered en route to its destination. A unit type's
   bonusVs table (entities.js) adds extra damage against a specific
   target type — Bastion's slow, short-range bulk is built to punch
   through Skiff hulls specifically.

   A plain 'move' order is the deliberate exception: it's how a player
   pulls a unit OUT of a fight or redirects it past a threat, so it
   skips auto-acquire entirely rather than getting silently overridden
   the moment an enemy wanders into aggro range.
