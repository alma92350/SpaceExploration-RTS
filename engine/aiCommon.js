   AI — shared primitives used by every decision phase (engine/ai.js and the
   aiEconomy / aiMilitary / aiIndustry phase modules): owner resolution
   (controllerFor/otherOwner), the APM action budget (the configurable AI
   speed), the reserve-aware affordability check, the "which idle worker founds
   this building" pick, and the found-a-building protocol those picks feed.

   Imports only DOWNWARD, into commands/colliders — never back into an AI phase
   module — so the phase modules can all share it without a cycle. That is the
   invariant, not "no engine imports": commands.js and colliders.js have no
   route back to the AI layer, and test/static-integrity.test.js's SCC check
   holds the whole engine to it.

// (state.ai.apm — or, for a self-play "player" controller, state.playerAi.apm). Every command it
// issues — produce, build, expand, research, send the scout — costs one action; the attack commit
// is the one exemption, so a slow AI still throws whatever it has at you and the game always
// resolves. Credits accrue continuously and cap at a few seconds' worth, so a busy AI can't hoard a
// giant burst. When apm is null (the default, and every headless test) the AI is unthrottled —
// behaviour is exactly as before. `owner` defaults to "ai" so every pre-existing call site
// (accrueActionBudget(state, dt), canAct(state), spend(state)) keeps reading/writing state.ai
// exactly as before; a self-play caller passes ctx.owner explicitly so the "player" controller
// spends from ITS OWN budget, never state.ai's — see engine/ai.js/aiMilitary.js/aiEconomy.js.
//
// A BACKGROUND colony (state.background, engine/galaxy.js — a world that isn't the player's
// current seat) accrues at HALF its configured apm: nobody's actively watching it, so it manages
// its economy at half pace rather than as briskly as the seat you're actually on. This halves only
// the accrual rate (and, since the burst cap below is derived from the same value, its burst
// reserve too) — never the controller's apm itself, which stays exactly what difficulty picked for
// every other reader (display, save/load, the neighbour-profile tests) — and never the attack/
// defense commit exemption (canAct/spend below), so a background world under attack still always
// throws whatever it has and the game still always resolves.

// fail SILENTLY when dropped — omit `spend` and the AI founds buildings for free (its APM
// dial quietly stops throttling it), omit `canAct` and it ignores the budget outright.
// Neither shows up as a crash, and neither shows up in a determinism fingerprint on the
// default archetype, because the default AI has `apm == null` and both calls are then
// no-ops. Only the APM-limited difficulties and self-play can see the difference.
//
// findPlacement is what makes the fixed build offsets safe: a node or an earlier building
// squatting on the nominal spot would make issueBuild reject the identical coordinates
// every think cycle and stall the order forever, so the search slides it to the nearest
// valid ground instead.
//
// `workers` is a candidate list, not a single unit, because the builder is chosen by
// distance to the spot that placement actually settled on — which isn't known until after
// the search. Two sites (the Habitat and the first Barracks) historically founded with
// workers[0] rather than the nearest free worker; they pass [workers[0]] so the pick is
// forced to that same unit, since pickBuilder returns a lone candidate either way. Widening
// them to the full list would change which unit walks to the site, and with it the
// determinism fingerprint — a behaviour change, not a refactor.
