/* ============================================================
   AI — worker assignment and the unit-mix filters. Idle-worker logistics +
   gather steering (assignAiLogistics / assignIdleWorkers), and the map-aware
   mix helpers the production phases read: which unit types this world can
   actually sustain (effectiveMix / affordableOnSurface), whether a developing
   AI's PLANNED mix should extend past its archetype's own tiers (plannedMix /
   wantsDeepIndustry — the shared signal aiEconomy's Foundry/Arsenal gates and
   aiIndustry's factory climb both key off), and which upgrade doctrine its
   economy favours (aiDoctrine). A leaf module for the other AI PHASE modules
   (aiMilitary/aiEconomy/aiIndustry import from it freely, never the reverse)
   — it only reaches sideways into two pure-data tables of its own,
   aiStrategy.js and aiDifficulty.js, neither of which imports anything back.

// Also drops any unit whose TECH prereqs aren't met yet (Lancer/Breacher before
