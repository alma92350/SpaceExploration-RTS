/* ============================================================
   The Odyssey galaxy — the open-world meta-layer over the per-planet sim. A
   galaxy holds one engine game state per planet (each a normal createGameState);
   one is "active" (rendered + controlled by the player) and ticks at full rate,
   while the worlds you've left keep evolving in the background on a coarser
   schedule (stepGalaxy). The player has a single, relocatable Command Center:
   their capital seat travels with them via a Spaceport (jumpCapital), and a world
   they leave stays a colony that keeps producing and sends home passive income.

   This module owns everything meta: the world roster, universal credits, the
   active planet, the per-frame advance (stepGalaxy), background-colony upkeep +
   notifications (sweepColonies), a status snapshot for the starmap (galaxyStatus),
   and the jump. The per-planet engine is untouched — a planet is just a normal
   createGameState flagged `endless` (no victory, no clock — see engine/victory.js).

   Determinism: the start world and every planet's map are derived from the galaxy
   seed, and the background schedule is keyed to the integer `galaxy.tick`, so the
   same seed replays the same galaxy — the same guarantee as the skirmish sim.

/* ---------- THE RIVAL GATE (docs/improvement-proposals.md "the galaxy's strongest faction races
   its own wonder" + "a fully-teched neighbour races its own Antimatter Gate", merged per the
   Phase 7 plan — two independently-written proposals describing the same feature, reconciled
   into one mechanism here).

   The TRIGGER (whether a world raises and charges its own Gate at all) lives entirely in
   engine/aiIndustry.js's rivalGateEligible/RIVAL_GATE_BUFFER — every qualifying world builds its
   own Gate independently, self-contained, on its own think cycle, exactly like every other
   aiIndustry.js building decision. This module's job is narrower: pick which ONE currently-
   charging world is surfaced to the player as THE Rival Gate (checkExpansion's own most-
   developed, tie-by-id idiom, just above — deterministic, no clock/RNG), track its live charge
   for the starmap, and apply the 'ascension' consequence to EVERY world whose Gate completes —
   not only the tracked one, so two simultaneously-eligible worlds (a rare but real possibility on
   a Hard-heavy galaxy) can't let a second Gate complete unnoticed just because this scan happened
   to be watching a different one.

   THE ASCENSION CONSEQUENCE deliberately COMBINES both twins' proposals rather than picking one:
   the claimed-neighbours burst (Defense twin) AND the hardEdge upgrade + a permanent stance
   ceiling (AI twin) are not mutually exclusive, and the trigger is already double-gated (the
   Strategic tier banked AND Hard/wantsDeepIndustry) — a genuinely rare, hard-earned event, so
   escalating hard on it reads as "the galaxy changed under you" (the Defense twin's own framing)
   rather than as pile-on. Never a defeat: state.over is never touched by any of this. */

// The AI twin's proposal literally says "a permanent stance floor" for the ascension; taken
// literally that would HELP the player (the same shape as diplomacy.js's own APPEASE_FLOOR truce
// line), which contradicts its own framing as a "penalty toward the player" — so this reads it as
// a permanent CEILING instead: the ascended world's stance can never rise back past Wary, no
// matter how the scarcity/development pull on it evolves. Reapplied every scan (below), not a
// one-time snap — updateDiplomacy's own drift would otherwise claw it back up, and the AI twin's
// own "Where" note explicitly keeps this out of engine/diplomacy.js ("needs no change").
//
// EXCEPT once the player has personally pacified that same world (Domination with teeth,
// checkDomination/dip.pacified below): conquest is the more direct, more recent player action, so
// it wins over a stale ascension from before the capital fell. Without this guard the ceiling and
// the pacified floor fight forever — the ceiling reasserts every scan and always wins the raw
// stance value between updateDiplomacy's slower drift ticks, so razing an ascended neighbour's
// Command Center would have no visible effect on its stance, which reads as broken in play.
