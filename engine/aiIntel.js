   AI INTEL — what the AI BELIEVES about its opponent (docs/ai-adaptive-opponent.md)

   Every other reactive read in the AI answers a question about right now: are there enemies at my
   base (visibleThreatsNearHome), how many can I see (visibleEnemyForceCount), what do they field
   most (counterToPlayerArmy). Each drives one hardcoded reaction, and none of them survives losing
   sight of the enemy — entity sighting goes through the LIVE fog layer (isVisibleAt), so the
   instant a scout dies the AI's picture of its opponent is empty and it has no way to know it.

   This module holds the other kind of knowledge: a BELIEF about what sort of game the opponent is
   playing, which persists between sightings and decays when it goes unrefreshed. It is the first
   piece of AI state that can be WRONG — every other read is a fact about the current frame — and
   that is the point. An opponent model you can deceive is what makes scouting worth its cost and
   what makes killing the scout a real counter-play.

   THREE THINGS IT REPORTS, and why they are three and not one:

     mil / eco    Ore-value of the enemy's military and economic assets, as far as `owner` has seen.
     posture      mil / (mil + eco) — 0 is a pure economy game, 1 is a pure war game. THE read.
     confidence   How much has been seen, and how recently.

   Confidence is separate from posture on purpose. "I have seen nothing" and "I have seen an empty
   base" are completely different situations, and a single number cannot tell them apart —
   collapsing them is exactly how an AI ends up confidently raiding into an army it never scouted.
   Low confidence means hedge and go look, not "the enemy is weak".

   THE BELIEF IS A FADING HIGH-WATER MARK, not an average of sightings. Seeing two units near my
   base tells me the enemy has AT LEAST that much; it says nothing about the army parked at home.
   So a sighting can only ever raise the estimate, and time is the only thing that lowers it. That
   also makes the read stable under the thing that would otherwise wreck it — an army walking in and
   out of vision — while still letting a genuinely disbanded force fade away.

   PURE AND FOG-LIMITED. No clock beyond state.time, no randomness, no reach into the other side's
   fog: every read resolves from `owner`'s own state.fogs[owner] and otherOwner(owner), so it drives
   either seat in self-play (see engine/ai.js's runAI header). The engine-purity and determinism
   guards cover this file like any other.

   MODE — the smoothed stance the AI actually acts on

   `posture` is the raw read and is far too jumpy to drive investment decisions directly: it moves
   every time a wave walks past. `adaptMode` is the damped version — the same 0..1 scale, but it
   only moves when the read has genuinely shifted, and then only slowly.

   BOTH damping terms are load-bearing, and for different reasons:

     dead band   Two adaptive AIs facing each other form a feedback loop — A goes economy, B raids,
                 A goes military, B turtles, A goes economy — and an undamped controller oscillates
                 in it forever instead of settling. The band means small reads change nothing.
     rate limit  Even a real shift is absorbed over many think cycles rather than in one, so the
                 opponent stays LEGIBLE. A player has to be able to notice "it's turtling now" and
                 respond; an AI that reconfigures itself instantly is not a harder opponent, it is
                 an unreadable one. This is the same argument engine/aiDifficulty.js makes for
                 Easy's counterEvery: 0, applied to stance instead of composition.

   Confidence gates the whole thing: an unscouted enemy cannot move the mode at all, so the AI
   hedges at neutral and goes looking rather than committing to a stance it cannot justify.
