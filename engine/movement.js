/* ============================================================
   Movement with local avoidance: a unit senses same-owner neighbors
   ahead of it and steers sideways around them, instead of walking
   straight through and only getting untangled after the fact by
   separation.js's reactive correction pass (still there as a safety
   net for cases avoidance alone can't resolve, like several units
   genuinely told to stand on the same point).

   Steering is lateral (perpendicular to the direction of travel), not a
   straight push-back — a neighbor sitting exactly on the travel line has
   zero radial sideways component by symmetry, so pure repulsion stalls
   an approaching unit directly behind it forever instead of routing
   around. A deterministic per-pair tie-break picks a side for that
   dead-ahead case so the choice doesn't flicker frame to frame.
