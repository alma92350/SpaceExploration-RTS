/* ============================================================
   Scripted AI opponent: keep workers on the nearest spendable node, keep
   population growing, put up a Barracks once it can afford one, then cycle
   through its archetype's unit mix (Skiff/Bastion/Lancer/Breacher — see
   entities.js for the rock-paper-scissors relationship) across every
   Barracks it owns, and throw its home army at the enemy base in
   repeated waves, once each wave is big enough (or the game's dragged on
   long enough that it should commit anyway). Along the way it fortifies
   with Sentinel Turrets on the approach vector, expands to a second
   Command Center when its home ore runs thin, puts up a Refinery, and
   researches both upgrades — so its opponent isn't the only side that gets
   to use crystals/radioactives, expansions, or defenses.

   The AI plays under its own fog of war (state.fogs[owner], never a
   hardcoded state.fogAI) — it is NOT omniscient. It keeps one unit out
   scouting (updateScout), and its intel-dependent moves are gated by what
   it has actually seen: every few units it breaks from the mix to counter
   whatever the enemy fields most, but only counting enemy units currently
   in its vision (counterToPlayerArmy); and it only mines or expands to
   nodes it has discovered — charted surface deposits always, hidden caches
   once scouted. The rest of the cycle follows the archetype's own flavor,
   so a Rusher doesn't turn into a pure reactive counter-picker.

   How aggressively vs. how patiently it plays — worker/army targets, attack
   timing, unit mix, how many turrets and barracks, when to expand — all comes
   from its controller's `archetype` (see engine/aiArchetypes.js), which is
   picked by which planet the match is on. This file just executes whatever
   profile it's handed; every Tier 4 field is read with a use-site default so
   a legacy profile that predates them still runs.

   Layered on top of the archetype is the controller's `strategy` (engine/
   aiStrategy.js) — a player-picked overlay (setup.js "AI Strategy"), orthogonal
   to which planet/archetype it's facing: Aggressive presses the attack earlier
   and forces the issue in Odyssey; Economic keeps a minimal standing army until
   it's actually attacked, then surges; Force Parity continuously matches
   whatever it's seen of the enemy's army. "default" (unset) reproduces today's
   pure archetype-driven play byte-for-byte — every multiplier defaults to 1 and
   every flag to falsy.

   TIER 1 SELF-PLAY (tools/selfplay.js — a headless bench, never the shipped
   game): runAI(state, dt, owner) drives EITHER side. owner defaults to "ai",
   so every pre-existing call site (engine/sim.js's per-tick runAI(state, dt),
   every one of the ~26 test files that touch state.ai) gets exactly today's
   behavior, unchanged. Passing owner="player" instead drives a SECOND,
   independently-configured controller for the human seat — state.playerAi,
   null unless a caller has populated it — with its own archetype/strategy/
   difficulty/APM/action budget, reading state.fogs.player (never state.fogAI)
   everywhere it looks at the world. state.ai and its exact meaning for owner
   "ai" are completely untouched by any of this. See aiCommon.js's
   controllerFor/otherOwner for how a phase resolves "my controller" and "my
   opponent" from `owner` alone.

   This file is the ORCHESTRATOR: runAI runs the think-cycle and threads one
   world snapshot (aiContext) through the decision phases, which live in cohesive
   sibling modules so no single file is a 1000-line god object —
     • aiCommon.js     — owner resolution + the APM action budget + reserve-aware affordability + builder pick
     • aiStrategy.js   — the player-picked strategy table (Aggressive/Economic/Force Parity)
     • aiWorkers.js    — idle-worker logistics/gather steering + the unit-mix filters
     • aiMilitary.js   — defend/attack waves, focus-fire, the scout, target/mix picks
     • aiEconomy.js    — base build-out, expansion, tech gates, production, research, market barter
     • aiIndustry.js   — the Odyssey factory chain / power / capital path / rig
     • aiSuperweapon.js — arms/delivers a built Helium Bomb
   The phase order in runAI is load-bearing (shared action budget + ore reserves),
   so it stays here where the whole sequence reads top-to-bottom.
