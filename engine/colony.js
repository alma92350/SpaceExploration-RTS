/* ============================================================
   COLONY SHIP (Odyssey) — the mobile seed of a base. In the open world both sides
   START with a colony ship instead of a placed Command Center, and found every new
   base by building a ship, moving it to the site, and DEPLOYING it in place. Deploy
   is an instant, pure state mutation (like engine/galaxy.js upgradeToCapital): it
   validates the footprint, consumes the ship, and mints a COMPLETED Command Center
   plus the colonists that ride in — so ship→CC is atomic (no "foothold gap" for the
   loss/domination checks, engine/victory.js + engine/galaxy.js).

   Odyssey-only by construction: the colonyship unit is `odysseyOnly` and never
   instantiated in a skirmish, so this module is inert there. Deterministic and
   DOM-free — no wall-clock, no unseeded randomness.
