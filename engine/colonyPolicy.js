/* ============================================================
   Colony standing orders — the second half of the Phase 6 colony-economy rework
   (the first half is engine/galaxy.js's Freight Lanes; the roadmap explicitly calls
   these "two halves of a single rework", designed together).

   A held colony you leave keeps SIMULATING (stepGalaxy), but until now the player
   side of it got no new orders: production queues emptied and stayed empty, workers
   idled by a depleted node never reassigned, and manufactured surplus piled up in the
   stockpile doing nothing — passive income was a flat, capped 0.3 credits/s/building
   (COLONY_INCOME_PER_BUILDING/COLONY_INCOME_CAP, engine/galaxy.js sweepColonies)
   completely divorced from what the colony actually produces.

   This module is a small per-colony POLICY STORE on the galaxy (a Map
   planetId -> {autoSell, workerTarget}), executed once per throttled galaxy scan
   (stepGalaxy's PROGRESS_CHECK_EVERY block — see runColonyPolicies' own header)
   for BACKGROUND worlds only; the active/rendered seat takes real player orders
   instead, exactly like sweepColonies' own income sweep.

   Two standing orders, both opt-in (off by default — a fresh policy is inert):
     • Auto-sell surplus — sell stock above a per-commodity floor into the world's
       OWN market via the real sell() path (engine/market.js): real slippage, real
       glut. This makes passive income the colony's actual PRODUCTION, and the
       market's own math is what bounds the runaway-annuity worry the
       COLONY_INCOME_CAP comment raises — no separate cap needed here. It's
       ADDITIVE on top of the flat per-building income (sweepColonies), not a
       replacement for it — the flat rate stays the floor under every colony,
       auto-sell is the extra a colony that's actually producing earns on top.
     • Sustain workers — re-queue one worker at the Command Center (paid from the
       COLONY'S OWN stockpile, via production.js queueProduction — never galaxy
       credits) when under a target headcount, and re-task any idle player worker
       on the world to gather (aiWorkers.js's owner-generic assignIdlePlayerGather).

   Deterministic like the rest of the galaxy scheduler: runColonyPolicies is called
   on an INTEGER galaxy.tick schedule (stepGalaxy), iterates galaxy.planets in its
   one fixed Map order (the same order sweepColonies already relies on), and reaches
   for no clock or RNG anywhere in this file.
