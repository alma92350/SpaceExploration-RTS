/* ============================================================
   AI DIFFICULTY — the Easy/Medium/Hard pick from the splash screen, orthogonal to
   both the archetype (engine/aiArchetypes.js — which planet/temperament) and the
   player-picked strategy (engine/aiStrategy.js — whether/when it voluntarily
   attacks). Bundles the two original dials — how FAST the opponent acts (aiApm)
   and whether it MICROS its army (aiMicro) — plus the picker's own label/note.
   This is the ONE list of valid difficulty keys: it drives the Easy/Medium/Hard
   buttons in setup.js AND (via boot.js's difficultyDials, which looks a key up in
   this same array) the AI dials a match actually runs with — so a key can never
   exist in one place and not the other, which used to let a mismatched difficulty
   silently downgrade to Medium instead of erroring.

   Economic dials land here as more fields on an entry, read through
   difficultyFor(state) the same defensive way engine/aiStrategy.js's
   strategyFor(state) already reads STRATEGIES — a multiplier field with `|| 1`
   at its use site, a flag read falsy — so an absent field or a legacy/unknown key
   composes as a no-op. Medium carries none of them at all (byte-identical to
   unset), same as STRATEGIES.default — it's the baseline every dial is relative to.

   Tier 1 dials (worker target, war patience, economic edge) compose
   MULTIPLICATIVELY on top of whatever the archetype and player-picked strategy
   already contribute — the same relationship Aggressive/Economic/Force Parity
   already have with the archetype's own Odyssey overlay (aiArchetypes.js) — so
   this is one more layer, not a replacement:
     • workerTargetMult   — aiEconomy.js's workerTarget formula.
     • graceMult/grievanceMult — diplomacy.js's updateDiplomacy war-onset composition.
     • economicEdge       — seeds the synthetic `hardEdge` UPGRADES entry
       (entities.js) onto the AI's own upgrades at creation (engine/state.js), which
       gather.js/production.js already pick up via the existing generic upgradeMult
       — no plumbing changes needed there at all.

   Tier 2 adds researchPaceMult — techtree.js's updateResearch applies it to the AI's OWN
   research only, never the player's, even on the same tech-rated world. That now reaches
   BOTH node tables it resolves: the Odyssey Datacenter tech tree AND the Refinery's
   doctrine upgrades (production.js's researchUpgrade queues and times them the same way,
   engine/entities.js UPGRADES) — so Hard's AI also develops its doctrine pick faster, and
   Easy's slower, than Medium's.

   Tier 3 adds marketAccess — unlocks market.js's aiBarter (called from
   aiEconomy.js's aiMarketBarter, gated through the AI's own APM budget like every
   other decision). Medium and Hard both get it; Easy doesn't, so a new player
   isn't shown an AI that "trades" in a way they can't yet see or counter. No
   separate throttle needed: Hard's higher APM already means more frequent
   barters for free, the same way it already means more frequent everything else.

   Tier 4 adds rusherGraduates (Hard only — the one identity-level change, not just
   a number): past aiIndustry.js's RUSHER_GRADUATE_TIME into an Odyssey world, a
   non-developing archetype (today, only a Rusher) picks up the deep factory chain
   a patient developer would, the same third condition strategy.wantsIndustryAlways
   already is on that gate. Skirmish is untouched by construction (aiIndustry.js
   returns on !state.endless before this is ever read).

   Tier 5 adds counterEvery — aiMilitary.js's pickNextUnitType reads it directly
   (not a multiplier: a cadence override, `?? COUNTER_EVERY` at the read site, so
   an absent value composes as today's fixed-3 cadence). Easy is 0 — it never
   counter-picks, so its army stays exactly its learnable, exploitable archetype
   mix; Hard is 2 — it reacts to the player's composition half again as fast as
   Medium's unchanged 3. Same "Medium carries none of it" baseline as every other
   tier.

   Tier 6 adds strategicCeiling (Easy only — the second identity-level dial,
   exactly the precedent Tier 4's header sets for rusherGraduates). aiIndustry.js's
   INDUSTRY_CHAIN climb and its RESEARCH_ORDER research both stop short of the
   Strategic tier (antimatterforge / 'antimatter' Containment onward) when this is
   set — which transitively withholds the Star Dock, the Leviathan, the Helium
   Bomb, the Plasma Rig, and (Phase 7) a rival Antimatter Gate, since every one of
   those sits downstream of that same chain. This is the identical argument this
   file's own Tier 3 already makes for withholding marketAccess from Easy ("a new
   player isn't shown an AI that trades in a way they can't yet see or counter")
   applied harder to the Strategic tier: a long enough Odyssey session would
   otherwise let even a placid Easy Economist climb to a 900-hp Leviathan and a
   doomsday bomb, exactly the escalation Easy exists to spare a new player from.
   Medium and Hard are untouched — a patient or graduated neighbour on either can
   still walk the whole chain, same as today.
