/* ============================================================
   The Antimatter Gate — Odyssey's endgame wonder (Phase 3). A `wonder:true`
   building that CHARGES by consuming strategic goods over time; at full charge the
   player wins the galaxy (engine/victory.js checkEndlessWin). This gives the
   endless Odyssey sandbox its first WIN condition — until now it could only be
   lost (checkEndlessLoss).

   Charging draws Power while it runs (industry.js powerDraw), so it TAXES the grid
   — your factories throttle down while the Gate charges, a real "charging costs you
   production" tension that more Reactors / Fusion Containment relieve. The charge
   itself isn't power-gated, though: it proceeds even if a Reactor is sniped (so a
   colony Gate can't be trivially stalled by killing one building). It IS clamped to
   the strategic goods in stock — a starved Gate waits rather than charging on
   nothing, and the stockpile never goes negative. Goods are spent as they're fed,
   so a Gate razed mid-charge costs the whole investment — a fat, defendable
   objective, not a fire-and-forget.

   Odyssey-only and inert-by-construction: the Gate is `odysseyOnly`, the skirmish
   AI never builds it, and updateWonder is a no-op for any building without the
   `wonder` flag — so the byte-identical skirmish path is untouched. Deterministic
   and DOM-free: dt-driven float math, no wall-clock, no unseeded randomness.

// by construction — the Gate is `odysseyOnly` and a skirmish never builds one, so this returns
// null in every skirmish regardless of owner. Pure scan of state.buildings, id-tiebroken (there
// is only ever one wonder per owner, in practice). NOT fog-gated: a charging antimatter Gate is
// a galaxy-wide event, sensed regardless of line-of-sight; a caller that needs visibility (the
// AI targeting the player's Gate, the player targeting a rival's) applies its OWN fog check at
// the seam that actually acts on it.
