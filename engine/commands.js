// Put a Ranger into autonomous scout mode (order type "scout"): it ranges the
// map on its own toward the nearest unexplored ground until re-ordered (see
// scout.js). Only scout-role units accept it, so issuing it to a mixed selection
// simply skips everything that isn't a Ranger. Clears any queued waypoints, like
// a plain command — the mode is persistent, not something to stack behind.
//
// A Ranger LEADING a formation keeps leading it here rather than abandoning it: its followers
// are left exactly as they are, still chasing it on their existing follow-leader order (the same
// "a new leader order never touches the followers' own orders" rule dispatchFormation's solo-move
// branch already relies on), and the scout order itself is capped to the group's speed
// (order.speedCap — the same group-minimum a move/attack-move/hold-formation leader gets, see
// groupSpeedCap/dispatchFormation above) so it doesn't outrun its own escorts — a protective scout
// leading the pack into the fog at ITS pace, not a lone unit racing off alone. A solo Ranger (no
// squadFollowers) scouts at its own full speed exactly as before — nothing to keep pace with.

// gathering it instead of standing idle at the point — the standard "rally to
// minerals" convenience. Non-workers just walk to the point.
