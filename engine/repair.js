/* ============================================================
   Support-role healing. Once per tick (after all this tick's combat has
   resolved), every Mender mends the friendly units and buildings around it.

   A single global pass — not a per-unit order — because the Mender's healing
   is passive and area-based: wherever it stands, it patches whatever friendly
   damage is in reach, no target-picking or micro required. Keeping it out of
   the order pipeline means a Mender can be moving, holding, or idle and still
   heal, exactly like a real support drone.

   Determinism: the amount each Mender adds is a fixed repairRate*dt, and every
   target is clamped to its own maxHp after each contribution. min(maxHp, ...)
   makes overlapping heals order-independent (two Menders on one unit reach the
   same capped hp regardless of Map iteration order), so this pass is safe for
   the same-seed replay guarantee.

/* ============================================================
   Bulwark doctrine regen (engine/entities.js UPGRADES.reinforcedBulwark / selfSealingPlating) —
   a SEPARATE pass from the Mender's updateRepair above: doctrine-gated (not every player has it),
   army-only (role:"combat" units, not buildings — this is the army's own attrition tool, not a
   base-repair one), and reads unit.lastHitAt (engine/combat.js performAttack/applySplash) rather
   than proximity to a healer.

   THE RECONCILIATION: docs/improvement-proposals.md's "Give the doctrine Tier-2s a verb" and
   "Tier-3 doctrine capstones" proposals were written independently and BOTH landed on "out-of-
   combat hp regen" as Bulwark's identity — one for reinforcedBulwark (Tier 2), one for a Tier-3
   capstone. Rather than ship two separately-tracked regen fields (a silent double-heal for a
   player who owns both, or a Tier-3 pick that just restates what Tier 2 already grants), this is
   ONE mechanic with two knobs, and selfSealingPlating (the capstone) is a genuine DEEPENING of
   it, not a repeat:
     - reinforcedBulwark (Tier 2) grants the verb itself: `regenRate` hp/s of passive hull regen,
       for role:"combat" units only, once `regenDelay` seconds have passed since the unit's last
       hit — "win attrition wars by cycling out of fights" (the proposal's own framing).
     - selfSealingPlating (Tier 3, requires reinforcedBulwark + arsenal) does not add a second
       regen source on top of the first — it replaces Tier 2's numbers with strictly better ones
       (3x the rate, well under half the delay — see entities.js), so a fully-committed Bulwark
       army both starts healing sooner after disengaging AND heals faster once it does. A
       Tier-2-only army must fully sit out a fight for 8s before it heals at all; a Tier-2+3 army
       peels a wounded unit out for a much shorter breather and patches it up quicker too — a
       measurable, tested difference (test/repair.test.js), not just a relabeled Tier-2.
   Both tiers read `regenRate`/`regenDelay` straight off whichever UPGRADES entry applies — not
   through the generic upgradeMult() product (entities.js): a rate and a delay aren't multipliers
   to stack, they're the two knobs of one mechanic, the same "read directly" idiom recycling's own
   capability flag already uses. bulwarkRegen() below picks the capstone's numbers over Tier-2's
   whenever both are present, so a save can never double-apply both tiers at once.

   Both tiers share the exact same gate — state.time - (unit.lastHitAt||0) > delay — so a unit
   under CONTINUOUS fire never crosses even the shortened Tier-3 delay: regen stays strictly
   out-of-combat at every tier, which is what keeps test/balance.test.js's auto-battle duels
   (continuous fire, no gaps) unaffected. See test/repair.test.js for the tier-vs-tier proof.
