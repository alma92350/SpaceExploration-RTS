/* ============================================================
   AI — the military brain: defend a pressed base, else muster and commit the
   next wave (aiMilitary / aiOffense), optional tactical focus-fire and the
   scout sweep, plus the target/mix helpers (chooseAttackTarget, raidTarget,
   pickNextUnitType and the counter-pick). Depends on aiCommon (action budget +
   owner resolution) and aiWorkers (effectiveMix); nothing in aiEconomy/aiIndustry
   depends back on it except through the exported pickNextUnitType, so there's no
   import cycle.

   OWNER-GENERIC (Tier 1 self-play, tools/selfplay.js): every function here that
   reacts to "the enemy" now takes (or reads off ctx) an `owner` — the side THIS
   call is deciding for — and resolves its opponent and its OWN fog from that,
   via engine/aiCommon.js's otherOwner/controllerFor. Every exported function
   defaults `owner` to "ai", so every pre-existing call site (every test, every
   other engine file, tools/ailab.js) reads exactly as before; only engine/ai.js's
   runAI(state, dt, owner) ever passes a different owner, and only when Tier 1
   self-play has populated state.playerAi. Never state.fogAI, never an unfogged
   raw-state read, for either side — that fog discipline is the single most
   important property of this whole module.
