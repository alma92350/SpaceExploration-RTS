/* ============================================================
   General collision separation: any two same-owner units — any type,
   however they got where they are (a shared rally point, a group order,
   two workers converging on one node, whatever) — get gently pushed
   apart the instant their bodies overlap. This runs every tick as a
   correction pass, independent of movement/orders, so it catches
   stacking from any source instead of needing a fix at each place an
   order gets assigned.

   Deliberately skips different-owner pairs: opposing units are meant to
   close to weapon range and stand there, not get shoved off it.

// high-_gi remainder within a single tick, and slid forward by the simulation's own tick
// counter so a pile sitting at a stable local density doesn't get stuck scanning the same
