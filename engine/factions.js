/* ============================================================
   Playable factions. A faction is a small bundle of PASSIVE trait
   multipliers — nothing more — so it changes how a side plays without
   touching the shared roster, the rock-paper-scissors triangle, the tech
   tree, or the AI's build logic. Every trait key is one the engine already
   reads through map.js's sideMod (speedMult, sightMult, gatherMult,
   buildTimeMult) plus one combat hook (damageDealtMult), so a faction's
   edge is applied exactly where a world's own modifier is — they stack
   multiplicatively and go through the identical code path.

   Design: three distinct identities on one axis each, balanced against a
   clear opportunity cost, so the pick is a real strategic fork rather than a
   power creep —
     • Frontier  — mobility & vision: strikes first, controls the map.
     • Miners    — industry: richer hauls and faster production; out-scales.
     • Syndicate — firepower on a lean economy: win the fight, and win it fast.
   `neutral` (no traits) is the default for a bare createGameState and every
   engine test, so the whole faction layer is opt-in — a match only gets an
   identity when the setup screen picks one, exactly like aiApm / aiMicro.
