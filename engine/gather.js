// A Command Center's "zone" is simply whichever of an owner's CCs sits nearest to a point — no

// restricted to the searcher's OWN zone (candidates whose nearest CC matches the searcher's), and —
// only if that comes back empty — once more with no restriction at all, today's plain global
// search. This is how haulers/servers/ferriers (engine/haul.js) and the auto-repair Mender/worker
// repair job (engine/repair.js) all stay loyal to their own base first and only "commute" to
// another one when their own genuinely has nothing queued — the fix for a multi-base empire
// where a saturated home base used to send idle labour on long, arbitrary cross-map treks the
// instant its own ≤2-per-target caps filled up.
//
// A one-CC game (nearly every test, and most real matches before a player expands) has exactly one
// zone, so the FIRST pass's candidate set is identical to the plain global one — `scan(inZone)` and
// `scan(null)` return the exact same answer, and behaviour is byte-identical to before this existed.
// `scan(inZone)` receives either a same-zone predicate `(x,y) => boolean` or `null` (no restriction);
// it does its own candidate loop/tie-break and returns its best match or null either way.
//
// `homeId`, when given, is a PLAYER-ASSIGNED override (`unit.homeCC`, engine/commands.js
// issueSetHomeBase — a right-click on a Command Center with eligible units selected) that wins over
// the usual "nearest CC by distance" guess: the player decides which base's territory a worker/
// Mender/freighter stays loyal to, not just raw distance. A stale override (its CC destroyed, or
// never valid) is ignored and this falls straight back to the distance guess — self-healing, same
// "never cache, recompute from state" shape as everything else here.
//
// The two cases behave differently once the home zone comes up EMPTY, by design:
//   - No override (or a stale one): the distance guess is just a heuristic, not a commitment, so an
//     empty home zone still widens to the whole empire — today's plain global search, a last resort.
//   - A VALID explicit override: the player deliberately assigned this base, so it's a hard
//     boundary, not a suggestion. An empty zone returns null (no job) rather than reaching into
//     another base's territory — the unit just waits for its OWN zone to need something, until the
//     player reassigns it to a different Command Center or clears the override outright.
