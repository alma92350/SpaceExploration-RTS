/* ============================================================
   The queued, TIMED research loop — shared by the Odyssey tech tree (TECHS, below;
   researched at a Datacenter) and the Refinery's doctrine upgrades (UPGRADES,
   engine/entities.js; researched in every mode, skirmish included). updateResearch
   resolves WHICH node table applies purely from building.type, so both run the
   SAME dt-driven development loop instead of two near-duplicate ones — see
   RESEARCH_TABLE_BY_BUILDING below. Either way, a node is PAID IN GATHERED
   COMMODITIES (the game's law — the resources you gather are the resources you
   spend, no separate research currency) and DEVELOPED OVER TIME, scaled by the
   world's tech rating so a Syndicate hub out-researches a frontier rock — which,
   for a doctrine upgrade, now makes a SKIRMISH world's own tech rating matter too.
   A completed node lands as an id in player.upgrades — the SAME bag either table
   reads back from — so it gates buildings/recipes through the existing prereqsMet
   primitive with zero new gating machinery. committedDoctrine/upgradeMult
   (entities.js) both guard on UPGRADES membership specifically, so a TECHS id
   parked in upgrades is invisible to the doctrine system; the passive-effect TECHS
   nodes are read here via techMult instead.

   The TECHS half stays Odyssey-only and inert-by-construction: the Datacenter is
   `odysseyOnly` and the skirmish AI never builds one, so the skirmish sim/AI path
   is untouched there (a TECHS id is never in a skirmish player.upgrades). The
   Refinery half is available — and now timed, where it used to be instant-on-
   payment — in BOTH modes; see production.js's researchUpgrade for its enqueue
   side. Deterministic and DOM-free either way: accrual is dt-driven float math
   with no wall-clock and no unseeded randomness.
