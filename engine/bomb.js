/* ============================================================
   The Helium Bomb (engine/entities.js UNITS.heliumbomb): a mobile doomsday
   device, built unarmed — free to move without risk. Once the player ARMS it
   (a direct field flip, `bomb.armed = true`, the same pattern hudSelection.js
   already uses for the Mender's auto-repair toggle), one of three triggers
   sets it off:
     - it takes a hit at all (combat.js's performAttack calls detonateIfAttacked
       before applying normal damage) — an impact fuze, instantaneous,
     - a live enemy unit or building comes within BOMB_DETECT_RANGE (checked
       once per tick from engine/sim.js via updateBombFuse) — lights the fuse,
     - the player manually triggers it ("Detonate Now" in hudSelection.js,
       which calls lightFuse) — also lights the fuse, not an instant blast.
   The two fuse-based triggers don't detonate on the spot: lightFuse just
   timestamps when the blast is due (BOMB_FUSE_DELAY sim-seconds later), and
   updateBombFuse (engine/sim.js, every tick) is what actually calls
   detonateBomb() once that time comes — a real window for the enemy that
   tripped it, or anything standing in the blast, to react. Being attacked
   stays instantaneous by design: it's a defensive reflex, not a timed device.
   Every path that DOES fire the actual blast funnels through detonateBomb()
   so they can never disagree about what it does. An UNARMED bomb ignores all
   three — it can be shot, stood next to, or driven right up to a base with no
   effect, exactly like any other unit — so arming is a deliberate, reversible
   (see disarm in hudSelection.js, which also cuts a lit fuse) commitment, not
   an inherent property of the unit.

   The blast radius is deliberately tied to POWER_TIERS[0] (engine/industry.js)
   — the same "on-grid" ring every Reactor/Generator projects — rather than an
   independent magic number: the bomb's damage reaches exactly as far as a
   power station's innermost efficiency zone, so the number on the tooltip can
   never silently drift from what the power-grid UI already shows the player.

   DAMAGE FALLOFF: the blast isn't a flat "erase everything inside the
   radius" cutoff — HP loss decays with the square of distance from ground
   zero (bombDamageAt below), same shape as a real blast's inverse-square
   falloff. Distance is measured to each caught entity's RIM, not its center
   (rimDistance below) — so a big building's own footprint doesn't stand
   between it and the peak band: at physical contact, a Gate or Command
   Center's hull IS inside BOMB_CORE_RADIUS, not 36-38 units short of it the
   way raw center-to-center distance would read it. The curve itself is still
   referenced against BOMB_CORE_RADIUS (1.5x the bomb's own footprint) rather
   than the true center, since 1/d^2 diverges as d->0; inside that "unitary
   distance" everything takes the same peak hit (BOMB_MAX_DAMAGE, enough to
   one-shot even the toughest building in the game), and it tapers off from
   there out to zero at BOMB_BLAST_RADIUS. So ground zero is still an
   indiscriminate kill, but a lightly-built unit caught out near the edge may
   only take a scratch instead of vanishing outright.

   TERRAFORMING: a detonation doesn't just erase — it also schedules a crater
   (state.craters) at the blast center. Once CRATER_SPAWN_DELAY of sim time
   passes, updateCraters (called every tick from engine/sim.js) turns it into
   a real, mineable ResourceNode, exactly like any node engine/map.js
   generates — gather.js, the fog/discovery rules, and the rendering all need
   zero special-casing for it, because it's a plain node once it exists. The
   commodity is chosen deterministically (hashStr off the crater's own id, the
   sim's only sanctioned source of pseudo-randomness besides the seeded RNG —
   see engine/rng.js) from every RAW-tier commodity, not just the ones this
   planet's deposit table naturally rolled — the blast synthesizes a deposit
   that wouldn't otherwise be here, which is the whole point of paying to
   "terraform" a spot rather than just scouting for one.

   WRECKAGE: separately from the crater, every unit/building the blast actually
   kills also deposits its own battle wreckage (engine/wreckage.js), exactly
   like an ordinary combat kill — the two stack, so a detonation leaves both
   the bomb's synthesized crater AND ordinary wreckage from everything caught
   in it.
