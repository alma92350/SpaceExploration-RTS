/* ============================================================
   The Odyssey market — universal credits and per-planet commodity trading. Each
   world has its own price book: a commodity's equilibrium price is its global
   base value nudged by LOCAL abundance (a world rich in ore sells it cheap, a
   world short on it pays more), so moving goods between worlds is what turns a
   local surplus into portable, galaxy-wide credits.

   Prices react to your trades: dumping stock pushes a commodity's price down
   (and buying pushes it up), then the pressure decays back toward equilibrium
   over time — so a big trade is worth spreading across worlds and cycles rather
   than firing off all at once. Credits live on the galaxy (engine/galaxy.js),
   not the planet, so they carry with you when you jump.

   Deterministic and DOM-free like the rest of the engine: prices are a pure
   function of the map's deposits and the running trade pressure.
