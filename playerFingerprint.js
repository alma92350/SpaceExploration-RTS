   PLAYER FINGERPRINT — measure a human, and fit an AI to them

   The point of the genome (docs/ai-evolution-design.md) was never only to let a search breed
   opponents. It was so a PLAYER could own one: edit a strategy into existence, or have their own
   play captured into an AI and then face it. This module is the second half of that — the bridge
   from "how this person actually played" to a runnable genome.

   Root-level, not under engine/, for exactly the reason elo.js gives for living here: a fingerprint
   is not simulation state. It is an observation ABOUT a match that the caller already ran, it
   changes nothing, and the sim neither produces nor consumes it. Pure: no clock, no randomness, no
   DOM — the same discipline that lets pairing.js and elo.js run in a Worker.

   NOT FOG-LIMITED, AND THAT IS THE POINT. engine/aiIntel.js reads an opponent through fog because
   an AI acting on what it has not scouted is cheating. This measures the player from ground truth,
   because it is not a gameplay decision at all — it is analysis of a finished game, the same way a
   replay is. Confusing the two would either cripple the fit or smuggle omniscience into the AI.

   WHAT IT CAN AND CANNOT SEE. A fingerprint is taken from a STATE, so it sees standing composition
   and investment: how much of their ore went into army versus economy, how many workers they kept,
   whether they walled, and what they actually built. That is most of "what kind of game are you
   playing". It cannot see TEMPO from a single snapshot — when they attacked, how often, whether
   they traded — because the sim keeps no player-side history to read. So the fit sets stance and
   investment honestly and leaves timing at its archetype default rather than inventing it; a
   sampled fingerprint over a whole match is the obvious upgrade and is noted in the design doc.
