/* ============================================================
   Observer Mode: a free-look, read-only spectator over the Odyssey galaxy — and, since
   docs/competitions-and-elo.md Phase 5, over a WATCHED AI-vs-AI exhibition match too. Toggle it
   on (O) to reveal fog on whichever world you're looking at, jump the camera to ANY world or base
   — yours or a neighbour's — for free, and read a live stats panel (observerPanel.js) instead of
   issuing orders.

   WHERE IT'S OFFERED, and why that list is exactly two entries. Observer Mode reveals fog and
   costs nothing, so it is only ever offered for a game the human is NOT playing competitively:
   the Odyssey (a play-forever sandbox with no opponent to cheat) and a spectated match between two
   AI entrants (game.spectateMatch, boot.js's startSpectatedMatch). Offering it in an ordinary
   player-vs-AI skirmish would just be a fog cheat, so enterObserverMode below refuses that case —
   the SAME early return that used to say "Odyssey only", widened by exactly one term.

   Deliberately does not touch `game.state`, `game.galaxy.activeId`, or the real input camera:
   it only changes what gets DRAWN (boot.js's render callback swaps in observedState() + the
   camera below while active) and reads state that's already simulating regardless of what's
   on screen (stepGalaxy advances every world in the galaxy every tick, active or backgrounded
   — see engine/galaxy.js). So exiting always resumes normal play exactly where it was left,
   and nothing here can affect the deterministic sim.

   input.js delegates its mouse/wheel/keydown handlers to the small helpers below while
   game.observerMode is on, instead of running its own selection/order logic against the wrong
   world.
