# The Odyssey AI — review, and a bench for tuning it

Two things live in this document:

1. **A review of the AI as it plays in Odyssey**, backed by measurements rather than by
   reading the source. Every claim below has a command that reproduces it.
2. **A proposal for searching and testing better AI strategies** with Claude Code, and the
   tool that makes it runnable — `tools/ailab.js`.

Each finding in §2 carries a **Status**: what was done about it, or why it was left. §5 is the
running ledger of experiments, including the ones that didn't work.

---

## 1. How the Odyssey AI is actually built

The opponent is one scripted controller (`engine/ai.js` `runAI`) whose behaviour comes from
**three plain-data tables composed multiplicatively**, plus a diplomacy ramp that gates
whether it may attack at all:

| Layer | File | What it sets | Chosen by |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Archetype** | `aiArchetypes.js` | temperament: worker target, army size, attack timeout, unit mix, turrets, barracks, expansion, doctrine, faction — plus an `odyssey:` overlay that only applies when `state.diplomacy` exists | the world (`PLANET_ARCHETYPE`) |
| **Strategy** | `aiStrategy.js` | aggression: whether/when it voluntarily attacks, standing-army cap, war-footing response | the player at setup — or, for neighbour worlds, uniformly at random |
| **Difficulty** | `aiDifficulty.js` | APM, micro, worker multiplier, grace/grievance, research pace, market access, rusher graduation | the player at setup — or, for neighbour worlds, uniformly at random |
| **Diplomacy** | `diplomacy.js` | a stance from +1 to −1 driven by scarcity, your kills, the neighbour's own development, late-game creep, tributes, and your Gate. `hostility()` scales muster size, committed fraction and wave cadence | emergent |

`runAI` threads one world snapshot through its decision phases in a load-bearing order
(scout → workers → found/survive → expand → base/tech → produce/fortify → research → barter →
industry → military → superweapon), all sharing an APM action budget and forward-passed ore
reserves. That order matters more than it looks — see §2.4.

**This architecture is genuinely good, and it is what makes the rest of this document
cheap.** Every dial is read defensively (`|| 1` for multipliers, falsy for flags), so an
absent layer is a no-op; the tables are plain exported objects; the sim is pure,
deterministic and headless. Adding a candidate AI is therefore *writing a row into a table*,
not editing the engine — which is exactly what a search loop needs.

Other things the review found worth stating plainly:

- The AI plays under its own fog (`state.fogAI`) and earns its intel with a scout. Its
  counter-picking, expansion targets and threat response are all honestly gated on what it
  has seen.
- Odyssey offence is a hostility-paced *probe ramp*, not a doomstack: muster, committed
  fraction and cadence all scale with `hostility()`, and there's a `playerHasPresence` guard
  so background worlds don't send waves at nobody.
- The Odyssey-only paths (`state.endless` / `state.diplomacy`) are cleanly separated from the
  skirmish path, which is why the skirmish stayed byte-identical through all of it.

---

## 2. What the bench measured, and what changed

Reproduce any row with the command under it. All runs are seeded and deterministic.

The soak is **11 worlds × 4 strategies, Medium, 40 sim-minutes each** — 44 runs, a few minutes of
wall clock. It is run against two opponents, because the answer differs completely between them:
`passive` (a player who seats a base and then does nothing) and `skirmisher` (a turtle economy
that throws its army at the AI whenever it musters one).

> **Numbers in this document are only comparable within a pass.** The detectors have been
> rewritten twice — 2026-07-30 and 2026-08-05 (§2.12) — and a count taken under one definition
> says nothing against a count taken under another. Every before/after pair below is therefore
> measured with ONE build of `tools/ailab.js` across both columns, via a `git worktree` at the
> older commit with today's bench copied in. Numbers are never carried across a metric change,
> and the tables are re-generated rather than edited. The table immediately below is the
> **2026-07-30 pass**, under that pass's own metric; §2.11 and §2.12 carry their own.

Before / after the fixes in the 2026-07-30 pass, under **identical** metric definitions — the
"before" column is the pre-fix engine measured with that day's bench, from a `git worktree` at the
pre-fix commit, not remembered numbers:

| detector | passive: before | passive: after | skirmisher: before | skirmisher: after |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `supply-deadlock` | 4 / 44 | **1 / 44** | 4 / 44 | 2 / 44 |
| `hoarding` | 14 / 44 | **2 / 44** | 5 / 44 | 1 / 44 |
| `dev-flatline` | 19 / 44 | **11 / 44** | 34 / 44 | 35 / 44 |
| `production-stall` | 18 / 44 | **18 / 44** | 9 / 44 | 7 / 44 |
| `hostile-but-idle` | 0 / 44 | **2 / 44** | 13 / 44 | 34 / 44 |
| **mean score** | 0.497 | **0.619** | 0.373 | 0.336 |

Read that table honestly, because two of its columns are not wins.

Against a **passive** player the AI is substantially better: it no longer wedges, no longer
hoards, and develops on eight more worlds. `production-stall` is the exception — it did not move
at all, across two attempts. Probing the worlds it fired on gave the explanation held at the time:
the residue was the Rusher archetype doing what it was designed to do (six workers, one Barracks)
on Medium, where `rusherGraduates` deliberately does not apply — not a stall the code can fix.

**That explanation is now superseded twice over, and it is worth saying so rather than leaving a
plausible sentence standing.** The Odyssey Rusher no longer runs six workers — §2.11 raised it to
nine — so "six workers, one Barracks" is not a description of anything the engine currently does.
And §2.12 then found that this detector was one of the two measuring the wrong thing entirely: it
counted samples where a Barracks was caught idle, with no test of whether the line ever restarted.
Both halves of the old story have to be re-derived under the current detector rather than quoted;
§2.12 carries the numbers that replace this row.

Against a **skirmisher** the mean fell, 0.373 → 0.336, and that number needs unpacking
rather than defending. Most of it is a denominator change: `hostile-but-idle` and the `pressure`
component now apply to the never-initiating strategies too, because provocation gives them
standing where before the question was dropped as unanswerable. They are being *measured* on
something they used to be excused from. Underneath it, the real story is §2.9 — the AI dies in
the first ten minutes, so none of the long-game fixes ever come into play. That is the next
decision to make, and it is not a code decision.

One methodological note, because it has now bitten five times across two passes: **a detector must
not fire on behaviour the design intends.** Scaling the AI up turned three of the five into false
positives in July — "any Barracks idle" fired on 42 of 44 healthy runs once surplus opened six of
them; a peak-based thrift measure scored a working economy (which peaks high and spends straight
back down) the same as a stalled one; and momentary supply pressure with a Habitat already going up
is not a deadlock — and scaling it up again in August did the same to the remaining two (§2.12).
Each was rewritten and pinned with a test. A metric that rewards the wrong thing is worse than no
metric, because the tuning loop optimises against it.

§2.12 turns that recurring lesson into a rule with a test behind it: a detector must pair its
symptom with a **non-resolution term**, and must not carry an absolute threshold calibrated
against one size of economy. `test/ailab.test.js` asserts the whole list stays silent on a healthy
curve scaled from 1× to 100×.

### 2.1 Half the galaxy's neighbours can never attack you

**Status: fixed.** `neverInitiates` now means *unprovoked* in Odyssey — a neighbour still commits
once the player has destroyed its ships or started charging a Gate (`engine/diplomacy.js`
`provoked()`, read by `aiOffense`). The skirmish path keeps the flag absolute, which is where the
original player report came from. `neighbourAiProfile`'s uniform sampling was deliberately left
alone: with provocation in place it now produces variety rather than dead worlds.

`STRATEGIES` has four rows; two of them (`economic`, `matching`) carry `neverInitiates: true`,
which blocks **every** voluntary commit. `neighbourAiProfile` (`engine/galaxy.js`) picks a
neighbour's strategy uniformly from `Object.keys(STRATEGIES)`, so in expectation **half the
worlds in a galaxy hold a strategy that cannot attack you, ever**, regardless of stance.

Measured across the full roster (11 worlds × 4 strategies, 40 sim-minutes, passive player):

- `economic` and `matching`: **0 waves in all 22 runs**, and the passive player's Command
  Center still standing in all 22 — with **every** sample where `hostility() >= 0.5` showing
  zero waves committed. That's the `hostile-but-idle` detector firing 22/44, i.e. on *exactly*
  the non-initiating half and nothing else.
- `default` and `aggressive`: 1–3 waves on most worlds (8 on helix), player base razed in the
  majority.

So the HUD reads *Hostile*, the stance is pinned at −1, and nothing comes. That is the
single most player-visible AI failure in the mode, and it is a distribution choice
(`neighbourAiProfile`) meeting an absolute flag (`neverInitiates`), not a bug in either.

The secondary effect is just as costly: a `neverInitiates` neighbour also never *spends*.
The four highest banked-resource runs in the roster are all `economic`/`matching`
(helix/matching 36,207 · helix/economic 30,785 · vesper/economic 30,679 · ferros/economic
28,678), because the strategy caps the standing army at 3–8 units and nothing else in the AI
can absorb the income.

```
node tools/ailab.js sweep --strategies economic,matching --minutes 40
```

`neverInitiates` is absolute *on purpose* — see the comment in `aiStrategy.js`; it was made
absolute to stop a passive player eating an unexplained all-in wave on the skirmish
desperation timeout. So the flag stayed; what changed is what counts as *unprovoked*. Note the
consequence for measurement: against the `passive` bot the non-initiating strategies still commit
nothing, and that is now the contract working, not a defect — which is why `hostile-but-idle` and
the `pressure` score component are gated on whether the AI was ever entitled to attack, and why
the bench gained a `skirmisher` opponent that actually fights.

### 2.2 A hard production deadlock that freezes a developed AI permanently

**Status: fixed**, in three parts — each of which re-froze production on its own once the one
before it was cleared. (1) The Habitat margin is sized from the biggest supply cost the AI could
actually try to pay (`maxSupplyDemand`), not a flat 2. (2) Supply already under construction is
credited, so one Habitat per 10 s no longer throttles a scaled-up production line. (3) Habitats
are placed at *any* of the AI's Command Centers — measured, a 70-building capital had no valid
spot left while its own expansions had room to spare.

The unit-mix cycle retries the same entry until it succeeds (`pickNextUnitType` indexes on
`unitsBuilt`, which only increments on success). The Habitat trigger in `aiBaseAndTech` fires
at `used >= cap - 2` — a margin sized for a 2-supply unit. The Odyssey roster contains
4-supply (Dreadnought, Aegis, Colossus) and 8-supply (Leviathan) units.

When the free supply lands in the gap — at least 2 but less than the next mix entry needs —
neither side moves: production can't queue, and the Habitat that would unblock it is never
triggered. Measured on kybernet at Medium, 50 sim-minutes, no player:

```
unitsBuilt 63 -> next mix entry: dreadnought  supplyCost 4
supply 156 / 158.6   free 2.6
habitat trigger (used >= cap-2)?  false
can queue next?                   false
ore 8031   radioactives 1994
```

The result is permanent: army frozen at 66 units from minute 40 to minute 60, both Barracks
queues empty, banked ore climbing 2,797 → 8,031 → 11,476 → 30,000+ with nothing to spend it
on. The world is finished for the rest of what is an unbounded session.

```
node tools/ailab.js probe --world kybernet --opponent none --minutes 60 --sample 10
```

### 2.3 The build order terminates — and this is a play-forever mode

**Status: fixed.** Two surplus sinks, both Odyssey-only. Sustained banked ore now opens extra
Barracks (bounded), and — for the strategies that cap their standing army, whose banks were the
four biggest in the roster — a surplus also funds a colony ship regardless of home depletion, so
a rich neighbour grows instead of hoarding.

Even without the deadlock, the AI's plan has an end: the factory chain, the tech order, one
Star Dock, one Plasma Rig, one Helium Bomb. Once it's climbed them, there is nothing left in
the script to buy. `INDUSTRY_CHAIN` and `RESEARCH_ORDER` are finite lists; `maxBarracks` is 1
or 2; there is no "spend surplus on more of what works" rule at all.

That shows up as the same signature as the deadlock — banked resources rising, army flat —
and it is why `thrift` scores 0.00 on every long developed run. A neighbour in a mode with no
end needs a terminal loop, not a terminal list.

It is also the most widespread finding by far: `production-stall` fires on **43 of 44** runs,
across every world and every strategy. The single exception (glacius/aggressive) missed the
detector's 0.25 threshold by scoring 0.11 — it stalled too, just less often.

**Update, 2026-08-01 — the two sinks above are both finite, and a long-enough Odyssey session
outlives them.** Raised by a player-uploaded Odyssey save (real play, not the bench): after
~118 sim-minutes, four background neighbours (kybernet, helix, forge, glacius — all
`economic`/`matching`) had fully researched every upgrade and built out to their Barracks-surplus
cap and (where room allowed) multiple Command Centers, and were **still** sitting on
8,000–34,000+ idle ore behind a garrison frozen at the strategy's bare floor — kybernet: 34,065
ore, 9,285 crystals, 9,240 radioactives, 3 units, unmoved for the whole observed session. Both
sinks are bounded on purpose (`SURPLUS_MAX_BARRACKS`, one cluster per colony ship) — that's not
the bug — but nothing picks up once they're both exhausted, and a living-galaxy world's income
never stops.

**Status: fixed.** `standingArmyCap()` (`engine/aiEconomy.js`) now adds a third, unbounded
surplus term — the same `SURPLUS_STEP` escalation shape as the Barracks sink — so sustained ore
lifts the army cap itself once the strategy's own floor is what's holding it back. Verified
directly (120-sim-minute probes, `--opponent none`, before vs. after): worlds that were frozen at
the floor for the entire run now keep growing — `helix/matching` 3 → 11 units, `forge/economic`
3 → 12 — while `default`/`aggressive` worlds (which never hit this cap; it returns `Infinity` for
them) are byte-identical, confirming the change is scoped to exactly the two strategies it
targets, and the skirmish path (`state.endless`-gated) is untouched.

```
node tools/ailab.js probe --world helix --strategy matching --opponent none --minutes 120 --sample 12
```

`sweep --minutes 40` (16-run: korrath/ferros/vesper/kybernet × 4 strategies) moved
**0.632 → 0.637** with **zero regressions** — `compare` shows every delta ≥ 0. The two
configurations that moved most were `korrath/matching` (+0.015) and `ferros/economic` (+0.065,
peak bank 10,420 → 6,736). Read the rest honestly rather than call it clean: the full 44-run
`check` at the default 60 minutes still fires `hoarding` on 2/44 (`korrath/matching`,
`oort/matching`). Both are cases where ore crosses the `SURPLUS_STEP` threshold only once, early
(3 → 4 units), then plateaus for the rest of the run because income hovers just under the next
2,000-ore step — so `armyGrowthTail` (growth in the *last third* only) reads zero even though the
world is no longer frozen at the floor. A steeper or continuously-scaled escalation would close
that gap but risks outgrowing supply faster than `aiBaseAndTech` can raise Habitats for it — left
as a follow-up, not bundled into this fix. `kybernet`/`glacius` (this section's own worst
offenders) are fully clear: their surplus was ore, and ore is exactly what this fix drains.

### 2.4 The Rusher never develops, and its Hard-only rescue lands ~30 minutes late

**Status: fixed.** `aiIndustryReserve` banks for the power grid and the first two chain buildings
before production can spend the ore, mirroring `ctx.foundryReserve`. Bounded to that bootstrap, so
a long chain never freezes the army for its whole length.

`rusherGraduates` (Hard) is meant to turn a Rusher into a developer after 20 minutes. On a
korrath background world it does not visibly land until ~50:

| sim time | dev (medium) | dev (hard) |
|---|---|---|
| 10m | 1 | 1 |
| 20m | 1 | 1 |
| 30m | 1 | 1 |
| 40m | 1 | 1 |
| 50m | 1 | 3 |
| 60m | 1 | 18 |

At Medium the Rusher is still on 6 workers, dev 1 and four distinct building types at
**60 minutes**. The mechanism is phase order, not the graduation gate: `aiProduceAndFortify`
runs *before* `aiIndustry` and holds no reserve, so a cheap-unit archetype spends ore down
below a Smelter's 160 every think cycle. The Foundry and Refinery already solve exactly this
with `ctx.foundryReserve` / `ctx.refineryReserve`; the industry chain has no equivalent.

It's all three Rusher worlds, not one: across korrath, nimbus and oort, **9 of 12 runs end at
dev 1** after 40 minutes. The three exceptions are the `economic` strategy, whose
`wantsIndustryAlways` flag bypasses the archetype gate entirely and takes them to dev 20 — so
the capability is there and reachable; it's the archetype path that can't get to it.

```
node tools/ailab.js probe --world korrath --difficulty hard --opponent none --minutes 60 --sample 10
```

### 2.5 A wiped neighbour is gone forever — *withdrawn: this is by design*

**Originally filed as a defect; it isn't.** `aiFoundOrSurvive` re-seats a razed base only from a
colony ship in hand, and `aiExpand`'s Odyssey branch only *produces* one when a standing Command
Center exists — so an AI that loses its CC with no ship in flight is permanently out. Against the
`turtle` bot an Aggressive Rusher on korrath threw itself away: base gone by minute 10, last
worker by minute 20, and 1,143 ore banked forever after.

But the second half of the original claim — "a background world can quietly die and stay dead" —
does not hold. A background world has no player and no third party, so nothing can raze the
neighbour's Command Center there; the AI cannot die unattended. The only way this state is
reachable is the player razing it, and that is exactly `galaxy.pacified`: a permanent conquest
milestone with its own toast, firework and domination counter. Letting the AI re-found would make
a world read "pacified" on the starmap while a live neighbour rebuilt on it.

Left as-is deliberately. The recoverable case (CC lost while an expansion ship is in flight) is
already covered by `aiFoundOrSurvive`.

```
node tools/ailab.js probe --world korrath --strategy aggressive --opponent turtle --minutes 25
```

### 2.6 The multiplicative layers have no clamp

**Status: fixed.** `effectiveDiplomacyMults` floors the composed grace multiplier and caps the
composed grievance one. The layers still compose — an Aggressive Hard Rusher is still much the
shortest fuse in the galaxy — they just can't compound into numbers nobody chose.

`graceMult` and `grievanceMult` multiply across all three layers with no bound:

```
grace = 420s × archetype × strategy × difficulty
      = 420 × 0.5 (Rusher) × 0.2 (Aggressive) × 0.9 (Hard) = 37.8s
```

The 7-minute opening grace — documented as the window that lets a player establish before a
world can turn — collapses to under 40 seconds on a reachable setup-screen combination
(Aggressive + Hard on a Rusher world). Grievance goes the other way: 0.04 × 2 × 1.6 × 1.15 =
0.147 per kill, so about ten kills drag a neighbour from its opening stance (+0.35) to fully
hostile. Neither is necessarily wrong, but both are *unintended* consequences of composition,
and nothing in the tests notices.

### 2.7 The AI does not play the Odyssey

**Status: deferred, deliberately.** This is a feature, not a defect: making the AI build
Spaceports, jump, and settle other worlds is galaxy-layer design work with real gameplay
consequences (what does a neighbour arriving on *your* world mean?), and it wants a decision from
the designer before any code. The bench is ready for it — `--opponent none` measures exactly the
background-world behaviour such a feature would change.

The neighbour plays a skirmish with extra buildings. It never builds a Spaceport, never
jumps, never settles another world, never trades for credits, never charges a Gate, never
offers or demands tribute. `checkExpansion` gives the *appearance* of faction spread, but it
is a starmap bookkeeping pass — it sets `galaxy.claims` and relabels the target world's AI
faction; no AI actually goes anywhere.

This is a design gap rather than a defect, and it's the largest single lever on how alive the
galaxy feels.

### 2.8 There is no AI-vs-AI, but there nearly is — *done*

**Status: shipped.** `runAI(state, dt, owner = "ai")` and its `aiContext` now resolve everything —
the controller (`controllerFor(state, owner)`: `state.ai` for `"ai"`, the new `state.playerAi` for
`"player"`), the enemy owner (`otherOwner`), and the fog grid (`state.fogs[owner]` — `state.fog`
and `state.fogAI` are now aliases into that same object) — from `owner` alone, instead of every
phase hardcoding `"ai"`/`state.fogAI`. `state.ai`'s shape and meaning for owner `"ai"` are
byte-identical to before; a `"player"` call is a safe no-op until a caller populates
`state.playerAi` (`engine/aiCommon.js`, `engine/aiMilitary.js`, `engine/aiEconomy.js`,
`engine/aiIndustry.js`, `engine/aiWorkers.js`, `engine/aiSuperweapon.js`, `engine/aiStrategy.js`,
`engine/aiDifficulty.js`, `engine/techtree.js`, `engine/persist.js` — the last extended
defensively, no `SAVE_VERSION` bump). The only caller is `tools/selfplay.js`, a new headless bench
(`createSelfPlayState`/`tickSelfPlay`/`runSelfPlayMatch`) — nothing in `setup.js`/`boot.js`/the
shipped game changed.

Two real fairness bugs were found and fixed on the way, both by independent adversarial review
rather than by the implementer noticing its own blind spot — worth naming because they're exactly
the class of bug a self-play system has to get right or the whole exercise is theater:

- **Hard difficulty's economic edge (`hardEdge`) was seeded onto `state.players.ai` only**, at
  `createGameState` time — a self-play `"player"` controller configured for Hard got none of the
  +10%/−10% edge an `"ai"`-owner Hard controller gets for free. Not a fog leak, a real "pays less"
  asymmetry baked into one-time setup rather than the per-tick phases. Fixed with an exported
  `seedDifficultyEdge(state, owner)`, called for `"player"` from `tools/selfplay.js` once
  `state.playerAi` exists.
- **`duel` (below) never varied which candidate played which owner slot**, so on a world with a
  map-baked `asym: { player, ai }` stat block (`oort`, `nimbus` — `engine/map.js`), the fixed side
  assignment decided the match, not candidate quality: two *identical* candidates measured 6–0 on
  one asym world and 1–5 on the other before the fix. Fixed by alternating `swapAsym` by replicate
  parity — every `duel` row now records which map side it actually ran.

See §3.2 for what this actually unlocked and §4 for the full record.

### 2.9 The AI cannot survive an early rush — *new, found while fixing the rest*

Building a sparring bot that actually fights (`--opponent skirmisher`: a turtle economy that
throws its army at the AI whenever it musters six units) opened a measurement none of the
original findings covered, and the answer is stark. On ferros the neighbour is **dead by minute
10** of a 40-minute run — no Command Center, no workers, and the world inert for the remaining
thirty minutes:

```
time  wrk army  dev bldg   banked  waves
  5m    7   1    3    7      494      0
 10m    0   0    0    0      662      0
 40m    0   0    0    0      662      0
```

It is not close, and it is not one world: the AI fails to survive on most of the roster. The
bot is not cheating — it deploys the same opening colony ship, mines with its own workers, and
pays for every unit.

**Status: reported, not fixed — this one is a design decision, not a defect.** Razing a
neighbour's Command Center is `galaxy.pacified`, an intended conquest milestone with its own
firework and a domination counter, so "a determined player can kill a neighbour" is the *feature*.
What the bench can say is that today the bar is very low and the same rush works everywhere.
Whether that bar should move — and how far — is a call about the difficulty curve of the whole
Odyssey, and it belongs to whoever owns that curve, not to a defect-fix pass.

Worth knowing before deciding: **none of the five fixes above touch this.** They all improve the
long game, and against a rushing opponent the long game never arrives. That is visible in the
comparison table at the top of this section — the passive column moves a lot, the skirmisher
column barely does.

```
node tools/ailab.js probe --world ferros --opponent skirmisher --minutes 40 --sample 5
```

**Update, 2026-07-31 — the bar moved, unintentionally.** The "Doctrine research develops over
time" change (`docs/improvement-proposals.md`) is unrelated to this section by design — it's a T1
telegraphing/pacing fix, not an AI-survivability change — but `git bisect` on a freshly-red
`test/ailab.test.js` traced a real regression to it (commit `4b95948`): on
`ferros/economic/skirmisher/seed=7`, the AI now loses every worker and building before it ever
fields a single combat unit, where before it still lost — per this section's own table — but got a
worker and an army unit out first. Isolating the cause (research-time duration, `aiResearch`
disabled outright, gating on `ctx.threats`) each changed the trajectory without restoring the old
outcome, so this reads as the already-described fragility interacting with the new economy
pressure of a paid-up-front, no-longer-instant Refinery purchase, not a one-line bug in the new
feature itself. Left as-is per this section's own verdict (a difficulty-curve call, not a defect-fix
one) — `test/ailab.test.js` now asserts on `buildings`, not `army`, so it once again documents
reality instead of drifting red. Repro: `node tools/ailab.js probe --world ferros --strategy
economic --opponent skirmisher --minutes 25 --sample 2 --seed 7` against commit `4b95948`'s parent
vs. itself.

### 2.10 Cooling off was the one part of temperament diplomacy left flat — *fixed*

Not a defect from the original review; raised afterwards, and it's the right observation. The
diplomacy layer flavoured how fast a neighbour *sours* (`grievanceMult`: a Warlord world at 2×, a
patient one at 1×) but every world *recovered* at the same rate, and `provoked` — the flag that
lets a never-initiating strategy answer back — latched permanently. So once you had fought anyone,
every temperament held the grudge identically and for ever.

**Status: fixed.** One `forgiveness` dial drives both halves of the cooldown:

- **The stance drift is now asymmetric.** Recovery runs at `DRIFT_RATE × forgiveness`; souring
  keeps the stock rate, because that direction is already `grievanceMult`'s job. A personality
  that forgives slowly must not also turn hostile slowly — that's a separate test.
- **Provocation is a timestamp, not a latch.** It fades after `PROVOKE_MEMORY / forgiveness`
  seconds of quiet, each fresh loss re-arms the clock, and a charging Gate provokes for as long as
  it charges regardless.

It composes across archetype × strategy × difficulty and is bounded like `graceMult`, giving a
spread of roughly 8× between the most and least forgiving reachable combinations:

| world / strategy / difficulty | forgiveness | grudge memory |
|---|---|---|
| korrath (Rusher) / Aggressive / Hard | 0.30 | 16.7 min |
| korrath (Rusher) / Adaptive / Medium | 0.50 | 10.0 min |
| vesper (Balanced) / Adaptive / Medium | 1.00 | 5.0 min |
| ferros (Economist) / Adaptive / Medium | 1.50 | 3.3 min |
| ferros (Economist) / Economic / Easy | 2.50 | 2.0 min |

In play: raid a Warlord world and it stays primed against you for most of a session; raid a
trading world, leave it alone for a few minutes, and it goes back to business.

Bench: the `passive` column is **byte-identical** across all five detectors (0.619 → 0.619), which
is the right answer — a player who never draws blood never provokes anyone, so the dial is a no-op
against that opponent. Against the `skirmisher` the mean rose 0.336 → 0.365 with `hostile-but-idle`
falling 34/44 → 18/44, but most of that is the *metric* getting fairer rather than the AI playing
better: a neighbour that has cooled off — or been killed — no longer counts as "hostile and
refusing to attack", because it is no longer entitled to attack.

### 2.11 The worker economy cannot bootstrap itself, and a tournament says so twice — *fixed*

Found by running the four shipped strategies against **each other** (`ailab duel --candidates`,
6 worlds × 2 seeds × both owner slots × Medium and Hard) rather than against a scripted sparring
bot. The standings were lopsided in a way that named its own cause:

| strategy | Medium | Hard |
|---|---|---|
| Economic | **51W-21L (71%)** | **49W-23L (68%)** |
| Force Parity | 36W-36L (50%) | 22W-50L (31%) |
| Adaptive | 32W-40L (44%) | 36W-36L (50%) |
| Aggressive | 25W-47L (35%) | 37W-35L (51%) |

Economic wins both brackets outright, and the solo `sweep` says the same thing from the other
direction — on the *same* archetype, changing only the strategy:

| ferros (Economist archetype) | development | workers | buildings | waves | score |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `default` | **3** | 13 | 15 | 1 | 0.419 |
| `economic` | **27** | — | — | 0 | 0.780 |

Same world, same archetype, same difficulty. The difference is that Economic *caps its standing
army*, and everything else follows from the ore that cap frees up.

**The mechanism.** `aiEconomy.js`'s Odyssey worker target is

```
archetype.workerTarget × strategy.workerTargetMult × difficulty.workerTargetMult + industryCount × 2
```

The only term that grows during a session is `industryCount × 2` — a *reward for industry the AI
has to be rich enough to have already built*. On a strategy that also spends freely on units
(`default`, `aggressive` — and `galaxy.js`'s `neighbourAiProfile` hands one of those to roughly
half the galaxy) unit production has first claim on every ore, industry never gets funded, the
worker target never grows, and the loop never starts. A neighbour stays on its opening crew for a
mode with no end.

That was confirmed by a single-dial probe, not by reading the code: giving `default` nothing but a
`standingArmyCap` of 12 on ferros moved development 3 → 28, workers 13 → 34, buildings 15 → 64 and
waves 1 → 11. Capping the army is not the fix — it is the *diagnosis*, because it is the only thing
that changed.

**Status: fixed, at both layers the tournament pointed at.**

- **Odyssey labour** (`aiArchetypes.js`): every archetype now carries an `odyssey.workerTarget`
  ~1.5× its skirmish crew — Rusher 6→9, Economist 11→17, Technologist (none)→11, Balanced
  (no overlay at all)→9. Balanced and the Technologist were the two archetypes that never got an
  Odyssey overlay when the Rusher and the Economist did, so four of the eleven worlds mined an
  hours-long session on a six-worker skirmish crew. Balanced's new block is **labour-only** — no
  temperament fields — so an even-handed neighbour still drifts on the stock diplomacy constants.
- **Aggressive's economy** (`aiStrategy.js`): `workerTargetMult: 1.25`, the same value the
  tournament winner carries. Aggressive's own offense dials could not rescue it — a coordinate scan
  over `armyAttackSizeMult` and `garrisonMult` moved 2W-6L to at best 3W-5L. Attacking sooner with
  less was never the problem; having nothing to follow up with was.

**The guardrail, in full.** `ailab check` (44 runs, 60 sim-minutes, Medium, `passive`), both
columns measured with the **current** bench — the detectors were rewritten the following day
(§2.12), so these are the re-generated numbers, not the ones this section originally shipped with:

| detector | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| `supply-deadlock` | 0 / 44 | 0 / 44 |
| `hoarding` | 2 / 44 | 2 / 44 |
| `dev-flatline` | 10 / 44 | **5 / 44** |
| `hostile-but-idle` | 4 / 44 | **0 / 44** |
| `production-stall` | 0 / 44 | 0 / 44 |

No regressions: two detectors improve and three are flat.

**That is not what this section said when it shipped, and the difference is the point of §2.12.**
Measured with the bench as it stood that day, the same two engines gave `supply-deadlock` 1/44 →
**6/44** and `production-stall` 18/44 → 17/44 — a regression this section documented at length and
handed back as an open question rather than papering over. It turned out to be the detector, not
the AI: both were written as "was this true right now, often enough?" with no test of whether the
state ever cleared, so an AI that grew fast enough to live at its supply ceiling tripped them
continuously. §2.12 has the full 2×2 and the rewrite.

The probe that made the diagnosis is still worth keeping, because it is the clearest single
picture of what §2.11 actually did — one 60-minute `ferros/aggressive` run against both engines:

| | Command Centers | buildings | supply used | habitats |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| before | **1** | 20 | 105 | 10 |
| after | **4** | 169 | 1,248 | 134 |

The neighbour that used to sit on one base for an hour now runs four, and its supply climbs
280 → 579 → 807 → 1,048 → 1,248 across the run.

Also recorded, and rejected on measurement: a fourth ore holdback (`ctx.supplyReserve` — a
Habitat's ore held back from unit production while blocked with none on the way) was built to fix
what looked like a real starvation loop. It changed `check` by nothing at all, all five detectors
byte-identical, because it cannot bind in real play: `aiBaseAndTech` runs before production, so
whenever the AI is blocked and can afford a Habitat it founds one that same phase, and when it
cannot afford 75 it cannot afford a 100-ore Skiff either. Reverted rather than shipped.

**And one dial that had to be tuned across difficulties to be tuned at all.** The first value tried
for Aggressive was 1.4, which wins Medium harder (54%) — and *loses* Hard, 51% → 44%. `aiDifficulty.js`'s
Hard row already carries `workerTargetMult: 1.25` and the layers compose multiplicatively, so 1.4
is really 1.75× there. 1.25 keeps almost all of the Medium gain and turns the Hard result positive.
This is §2.6's "the multiplicative layers have no clamp" showing up as a measurable loss rather
than a theoretical one; the composed product is now pinned by a test.

### 2.12 Two of the five detectors were measuring the wrong thing — *fixed*

**Status: fixed.** §2.11 shipped with one guardrail row going the wrong way (`supply-deadlock`
1/44 → 6/44) and deliberately did not touch the detector, on the grounds that sharpening a metric
whose number you are being judged on is not a decision the judged party should make. Taken up
separately, the answer turned out to be bigger than that one row.

**The pattern was in the detectors' own history.** Sort the five by the SHAPE of the predicate:

| | predicate | fate |
|---|---|---|
| `dev-flatline` | `devGrowthTail === 0 && devFinal < 12` | growth term — survived two scale-ups untouched |
| `hoarding` | `bankedFinal > 5000 && armyGrowthTail <= 0` | growth term — survived two scale-ups untouched |
| `hostile-but-idle` | fraction + an entitlement gate | gated in July, correct since |
| `supply-deadlock` | `supplyDeadlockFrac > 0.1` | **pure instantaneous fraction — broke** |
| `production-stall` | `idleRichFrac > 0.25` | **pure instantaneous fraction — broke** |

The two written as *"is this true right now, often enough?"* are exactly the two that have needed
rescuing, and the ones carrying a *"…and it never resolved"* term have never needed it. A busy AI
is momentarily blocked, momentarily idle and momentarily rich all the time; only a stuck one is
still in that state with nothing having moved.

**The rewrite**, in `tools/ailab.js`:

- `supply-deadlock` gains `&& supplyCapGrowthTail <= 0` — blocked, *and the ceiling never rose*.
- `production-stall` gains `&& armyGrowthTail <= 0` — idle, *and the army never grew*.
- Both money gates stop being absolute ore figures. `banked > 400` and `banked > 1000` are
  statements about one size of economy; they are now "could it afford the exact purchase that
  would have resolved this?" — a Habitat for the block, the next mix unit for the idle line
  (`sample()`'s `canAffordUnblock` / `canAffordNext`), which has no scale in it at all.

**The 2×2 that justifies it.** The same two engines — pre-§2.11 (`7890096`) and post-§2.11
(`b0673eb`) — measured under both the old and the new metric. The old-metric columns come from a
`git worktree` at the older commit with the *then*-current bench; the new-metric columns from the
same worktree with today's bench copied in, so each column pair is internally comparable:

| detector | before / old | after / old | before / **new** | after / **new** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `supply-deadlock` | 1 / 44 | **6 / 44** | 0 / 44 | 0 / 44 |
| `hoarding` | 2 / 44 | 2 / 44 | 2 / 44 | 2 / 44 |
| `dev-flatline` | 10 / 44 | 5 / 44 | 10 / 44 | 5 / 44 |
| `hostile-but-idle` | 4 / 44 | 0 / 44 | 4 / 44 | 0 / 44 |
| `production-stall` | **18 / 44** | 17 / 44 | **0 / 44** | **0 / 44** |

Three things to read out of it.

1. **The three untouched detectors reproduce exactly** across the metric change on the same engine
   (2, 10, 4). That is the re-baseline validating itself — if the worktree procedure were wrong,
   those would drift too.
2. **§2.11's regression was the detector, not the AI.** `supply-deadlock` is 0/44 on *both*
   engines under a predicate that asks whether the state ever cleared.
3. **`production-stall`'s 18/44 was never real.** That row has been in this document since
   2026-07-30, was attacked twice (once with parallel Habitats, once written off as "the Rusher
   doing what it is designed to do"), and under a predicate that checks whether the line restarted
   it is **zero on the pre-fix engine too**. Every one of those 18 runs had a growing army in the
   last third. The AI was never stalled; the detector was counting a Barracks caught between jobs.

**What the named-defect list is now**: `hoarding` 2/44 (`korrath/matching`, `oort/matching` — the
plateau case §2.3's ledger already describes) and `dev-flatline` 5/44. Nothing else fires.

**Both rewritten detectors are silent on the whole roster, and that is worth stating plainly**
rather than presenting as a clean sweep. They are regression guards now, not live findings. What
keeps them honest is that their liveness is asserted directly: `test/ailab.test.js` builds a
genuinely stuck curve for each and requires it to fire, at 1× and 20× scale, so "detects nothing"
can never quietly become "detects nothing, ever".

**And the guard that stops a fourth round of this.** Three of five detectors have now been
rewritten because they fired on a healthy AI that had merely got bigger, and each time it was
caught by a human reading a scoreboard and thinking *that world isn't stuck* — not a mechanism to
rely on. That judgement is now a property test: take a curve describing an AI that is
unambiguously doing well, scale every magnitude in it from 1× to 100×, and assert the whole list
stays silent. Run against the *old* predicates it fails immediately (`supply-deadlock` fires on the
healthy curve even at 1×), which is what makes it a real test rather than a passing one.

**Known boundary, stated rather than discovered later:** `production-stall`'s new growth term reads
"the army never grew", so an AI legitimately pinned at a configured Population cap (§2.11's 150
rung) would satisfy it. The bench never sets `popCap`, so this cannot arise in `check` — but a
future sweep that does set one should exclude those samples the way `armyCapped` already excludes
a strategy that caps its own army.

## 3. The proposal — searching for better AI with Claude Code

### 3.1 Why the usual approach doesn't work here

The existing suite is excellent at invariants (determinism, purity, "a skirmish resolves to a
winner on all nine worlds") and useless for quality. AI quality in Odyssey is a *curve over
40+ minutes* — does it keep developing, does it spend what it earns, does pressure arrive in
proportion to hostility — and no assertion expresses that. Every finding in section 2 sat in
a suite of ~90 green test files.

So the missing piece is not more tests. It's a **measurement loop**.

### 3.2 The bench: `tools/ailab.js`

Zero dependencies, Node stdlib only, in `tools/` (never `engine/`, which stays pure). It runs
the real sim headlessly — a 40-sim-minute world costs ~7 seconds — samples a metric set on a
fixed cadence, and prints a scoreboard.

```
node tools/ailab.js probe        # one configuration, full time series
node tools/ailab.js sweep        # a matrix of worlds × strategies × difficulties → scoreboard + JSON
node tools/ailab.js compare      # A/B two saved sweeps, per-configuration deltas
node tools/ailab.js search       # deterministic coordinate scan over a strategy's dials
node tools/ailab.js check        # the named-defect list from section 2, across the roster
node tools/ailab.js leaderboard  # rank N candidates against the SAME fixed opponent — see below
```

**A candidate AI is JSON, not a patch.** Because the three tables are plain objects read
through defensive accessors, `--overrides` writes rows into them before a run:

```json
{
  "strategies":   { "swarm":  { "armyAttackSizeMult": 0.5, "garrisonMult": 0.2 } },
  "archetypes":   { "rusher": { "odyssey": { "workerTarget": 9 } } },
  "difficulties": { "hard":   { "workerTargetMult": 1.4 } }
}
```

That is the whole reason this is a day of work and not a project: **the search space is
already a JSON document.**

**Sparring opponents.** An AI with nobody to react to is playing solitaire, so the bench
drives the player side with scripted bots through the engine's public command API:

| bot | what it is | the question it answers |
|---|---|---|
| `none` | no player at all | how does the development curve look on a background world? |
| `passive` | seats a base, never acts | does pressure ever arrive at all? the only bot that never draws blood |
| `turtle` | economy behind turrets, never attacks | can the AI crack a defended base? |
| `skirmisher` | turtle that also throws its army at the AI | does a provoked neighbour push back — and does the AI survive being rushed? |

**Metrics and score.** Six components, weighted in `WEIGHTS` and printed individually:
`develop` (climbs the chain), `keepGrowing` (still growing in the last third — the
play-forever requirement), `pressure` (commits waves once actually hostile), `thrift`
(spends what it earns), `liveness` (production never wedges), `survive`. The weights are
the definition of "better AI" and are meant to be argued with and edited; the components are
printed because a total nobody can decompose is a number nobody should trust.

**Health checks.** Each finding in section 2 is encoded as a named detector
(`supply-deadlock`, `hoarding`, `dev-flatline`, `hostile-but-idle`, `production-stall`) so it
is a reproducible list that shrinks as the AI improves, rather than a paragraph that rots.

`test/ailab.test.js` guards the bench itself: that runs are deterministic (or a "+0.04
improvement" is indistinguishable from noise) and that the override seam actually reaches the
sim (or every search measures the baseline against itself).

**Ranking candidates against each other — a proxy for a championship, not the real thing.**
Every command above measures ONE candidate against the fixed sparring bots. `leaderboard` ranks
several at once, with difficulty/opponent/worlds/seeds held IDENTICAL across every candidate — so
comparing them never hands one an APM or micro edge another one doesn't get — and prints the same
`score()` components, meaned per candidate, sorted best-first:

```
node tools/ailab.js leaderboard --candidates a.json,b.json,c.json [--difficulty medium] [--opponent tech]
```

Each candidate file is `{ "name": "...", "strategy": "aggressive", "overrides": {...} }` — see
`tools/candidates/` for five runnable examples (the four stock strategies plus one novel tweak).
**Read the result honestly: this is "beats the same non-adaptive yardstick," not "beats the other
candidates directly."** `leaderboard` stays a proxy on purpose — it's cheap, and it's still the
right tool when the question is "how does this dial change do against a fixed opponent." When the
question is actually "which of these strategies beats the *other one*," use `duel` instead.

**True head-to-head — `duel`, `swiss`.** §2.8's self-play refactor means two candidates can now
really fight, both driven by the real `runAI`, each with its own archetype/strategy/difficulty, in
a real skirmish resolved by `engine/victory.js`'s own elimination/score-at-clock rule — not a
sparring bot standing in for one side:

```
node tools/ailab.js duel --a a.json --b b.json [--worlds w1,w2] [--difficulties medium,hard] [--seeds 2]
node tools/ailab.js duel --candidates a.json,b.json,c.json ...     # round-robin, every pair once
node tools/ailab.js swiss --candidates a.json,b.json,c.json,d.json,... [--rounds N]   # for a large pool
```

Fairness is structural, not conventional: `pinnedDuelDials(difficulty)` reads the difficulty *once*
into one `dials` object that both sides' configs spread from, so apm/micro/difficulty cannot
diverge between candidates — every row reads them back off the live controllers to prove it, not
the CLI input. `duel` runs **side-swapped by default** (candidate A as `"ai"` *and* as `"player"`,
both reported separately, never blended) and keeps every `--difficulties` bracket separate rather
than averaging across them — collapsing either of those is exactly what would hide a side- or
APM-driven asymmetry (see §2.8's two bugs, both of which a naive single-direction, single-bracket
measurement would have missed). `swiss` is the same fair pairing, scheduled Swiss-style
(closest-standing pairs, rotated byes, `max(3, ⌈log₂n⌉)` rounds by default) for a candidate pool too
large for round-robin's quadratic match count. `search --tournament-against baseline.json` points
the existing coordinate-scan dial search at a candidate's `duel` standing against a fixed baseline
instead of its solo `score()` — same search mechanics, a fairer objective when what you're actually
optimizing for is beating another strategy, not a scripted bot.

Candidate files are identical in shape to `leaderboard`'s. All of it lives in `tools/ailab.js` and
`tools/selfplay.js`; see `test/ai-selfplay.test.js` and the duel/swiss tests in
`test/ailab.test.js` for the fairness guarantees pinned as tests, not just comments.

### 3.3 The loop to run with Claude Code

Packaged as a skill at `.claude/skills/ai-lab/SKILL.md`, so Claude picks it up whenever the
work is about tuning the opponent. The loop it encodes:

1. **Baseline** a sweep to JSON. Never compare against remembered numbers.
2. **Name the component you intend to move** before changing anything.
3. **One hypothesis**, expressed as an overrides file.
4. **Sweep the candidate, then `compare`** — read the per-configuration deltas, not the mean.
   A mean that improved because one world improved a lot is a regression in disguise.
5. **Guardrails, every time:** `npm test` (determinism, purity, the resolve guarantee),
   `ailab check` (the defect list must not grow), and a check that the skirmish path is
   untouched if only Odyssey was meant to change.
6. **Record it in the ledger below — including the failures**, so the next session doesn't
   re-run a dead end.

The division of labour that makes this worth doing: the bench supplies reproducibility and
measurement; Claude supplies the part that's expensive for a human — reading a 40-row
scoreboard against the code that produced it, forming a mechanism-level hypothesis, and
turning it into the next overrides file. The judgement about *what the AI should feel like*
stays with you, encoded in `WEIGHTS`.

### 3.4 Suggested order of work

Sequenced so each step makes the next one measurable:

1. **Fix the supply deadlock** (§2.2) — a one-line-shaped fix (size the Habitat trigger to
   the largest supply cost in the effective mix, or skip a mix entry that can't fit rather
   than retrying it). It's the cheapest, and it currently corrupts every long-run
   measurement.
2. **Give the industry chain an ore reserve** like the Foundry's (§2.4), so development isn't
   starved by unit production. Then re-measure whether `rusherGraduates` needs to exist.
3. **Add a surplus sink** (§2.3): more Barracks / more expansions / a repeatable late-game
   purchase, so a developed economy has somewhere to put its income. This is the change that
   makes "play forever" true for the AI as well as the player.
4. **Decide what a non-initiating neighbour means in Odyssey** (§2.1) — either weight
   `neighbourAiProfile` away from them, or give Odyssey a provocation path that a
   `neverInitiates` strategy still answers.
5. **Then** search the dials (§3.3). Tuning multipliers on top of a deadlocked, starving,
   hoarding AI is fitting noise.
6. **Done:** the controller is owner-parametric (§2.8) and self-play (`duel`/`swiss`, §3.2)
   replaces the sparring bots for head-to-head comparisons. `leaderboard`'s proxy signal is still
   the right tool against a fixed opponent; reach for `duel`/`swiss` when the question is which
   candidate beats the *other one*.

## 4. Search ledger

One row per experiment, including the ones that didn't work. Unrecorded negative results get
re-run.

| date | hypothesis | change | result | kept? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-07-30 | — (baseline) | — | passive **0.497** · skirmisher **0.373**. supply-deadlock 4/44 · hoarding 14/44 · dev-flatline 19/44 · production-stall 18/44 | n/a |
| 2026-07-30 | the five §2 defects are real and independently fixable | engine, TDD (§2.1–2.4, 2.6) | passive **0.619** (+0.122) · skirmisher **0.336** (-0.037). hoarding 14→2 · dev-flatline 19→11 · supply-deadlock 4→1 | **yes** |
| 2026-07-30 | extra Barracks alone will drain the hoard | Barracks escalation on surplus | no effect on `economic`/`matching` — a standing-army cap means extra capacity sits idle, so their bank kept climbing. Needed a second, in-character sink | partly — kept, but insufficient alone |
| 2026-07-30 | a rich neighbour should GROW, not stockpile | surplus also funds a colony ship | this is what actually moved hoarding 14→2 | **yes** |
| 2026-07-30 | `rusherGraduates` needs retuning | — | **not needed.** The graduation gate was fine; the 30-minute lag was unit production eating the ore first. Fixing the reserve fixed the symptom, so the dial was left alone | no change |
| 2026-07-30 | a wiped neighbour should be able to re-found (§2.5) | — | **rejected.** A background world has no player and no third party, so the AI cannot die unattended; the only path there is the player razing it, which is `galaxy.pacified` — permanent by design. A re-founding AI would show a world as "pacified" with a live neighbour rebuilding on it | no |
| 2026-07-30 | the bench's own detectors are still valid after the fixes | — | **no** — three of five became false positives on the scaled-up AI. Rewritten and pinned with tests; the pre-fix baseline was re-measured under the new definitions rather than compared across them | corrected |
| 2026-07-30 | temperament should govern the grievance/aggression COOLDOWN, not just the souring | `forgiveness` on archetype × strategy × difficulty, driving both the recovery drift and the provocation memory | a ~8× spread across reachable combinations (16.7 min of grudge down to 2.0). Bench: passive **0.619 → 0.619, byte-identical on all five detectors** (correct — a player who never draws blood never provokes anyone, so the dial is a no-op there); skirmisher **0.336 → 0.365**, `hostile-but-idle` 34/44 → 18/44. Read that second number carefully: most of it is the metric getting *fairer*, not the AI playing better — a neighbour that has cooled off, or died, no longer counts as "hostile and refusing to attack". Souring deliberately left on the stock rate, pinned by a test, since the obvious implementation would have slowed it too | **yes** |
| 2026-07-30 | `production-stall` is one Habitat per 10 s throttling the army | parallel Habitats when supply, not ore, is the bottleneck | **no** — 18/44 before, 18/44 after. Probing the worlds it fires on shows the residue is the Rusher archetype's designed economy (six workers, one Barracks) on Medium, where `rusherGraduates` doesn't apply. Kept anyway: it is what moved supply-deadlock 4→1 | kept, but it did not fix what it was aimed at |
| 2026-08-01 | the §2.3 Barracks/colony-ship surplus sinks are both finite, so a long-enough Odyssey session outlives them and hoarding returns once a neighbour is fully built out | let sustained ore lift the standing-army cap itself (`standingArmyCap` in `engine/aiEconomy.js`), same `SURPLUS_STEP` escalation shape, Odyssey-only | Raised by a player-uploaded Odyssey save: kybernet held 34,065 ore / 9,285 crystals / 9,240 radioactives behind a 3-unit garrison after ~118 sim-minutes with every upgrade researched and Barracks/CCs at cap. 120-min probes confirm the fix: `helix/matching` 3→11 units, `forge/economic` 3→12, both previously frozen at the floor all run. `sweep --minutes 40` (16 runs) 0.632→0.637, **zero regressions** (`compare`: every delta ≥ 0); `default`/`aggressive` configs byte-identical (never hit this cap). `check` (44 runs, 60 min) `hoarding` 2/44 residual (`korrath/matching`, `oort/matching`) — ore crosses the step threshold once early then plateaus just under the next one, so `armyGrowthTail`'s last-third window reads zero even though the world isn't frozen anymore; not the same failure as before | **yes** |
| 2026-08-03 | §2.8's owner-parametric refactor is buildable as a contained, additive change without touching the shipped single-AI game | `runAI(state, dt, owner = "ai")`, `state.playerAi` mirroring `state.ai`, `state.fogs[owner]` (`state.fog`/`state.fogAI` now aliases), `controllerFor`/`otherOwner` (`aiCommon.js`) threaded through every AI phase module; new headless bench `tools/selfplay.js` | Full suite 1850→1860 (10 new tests, `test/ai-selfplay.test.js`), zero regressions, `engine-purity`/determinism green. Independent adversarial review (fairness lens + correctness lens, run in parallel, neither trusting the implementer's self-report) found **one real high-severity bug before this was accepted**: Hard difficulty's `hardEdge` economic edge was seeded onto `state.players.ai` only, never a self-play `"player"` controller configured for Hard — a genuine "pays less" asymmetry, not a fog leak. Fixed with `seedDifficultyEdge(state, owner)`. Reviewers also independently falsified fog-isolation live (deliberately lighting single fog cells and confirming causally independent reads both directions) rather than trusting the shipped tests alone | **yes** |
| 2026-08-03 | a fair `duel` command (`tools/ailab.js`) can be built directly on the self-play refactor, reusing `engine/victory.js`'s own resolution rather than inventing one | `pinnedDuelDials()` reads difficulty once into one object both sides spread from; `runDuel`/`runRoundRobin` | 1860→1867 (7 new tests). Independent review found a **second real high-severity bug**: `duel` always seated candidate A as `"player"` and B as `"ai"`, so on a world with a map-baked `asym` block (`oort`, `nimbus`) the fixed side decided the match — two *identical* candidates measured 6W-0L on oort and 1W-5L on nimbus. Fixed by alternating `swapAsym` by replicate parity; the same repro then measured 4-2 / 3-3, consistent with ordinary variance | **yes** |
| 2026-08-03 | side-swap (both candidates play both owner slots) and never-blended difficulty brackets close the remaining "is one owner slot structurally easier" and "does averaging across difficulty hide an APM-driven edge" gaps `duel` alone couldn't rule out | `runSwappedDuel`/`runDuelBrackets`/`runRoundRobinSwapped`, side-swap on by default (no opt-out flag, "not an opt-in easy to forget") | 1867→1875 (8 new tests). Review found only non-blocking issues (a cosmetic aggregate-level difficulty-echo bug carried over from `duel`, and a documented note that the two swap directions sample different seeds so a disagreement between them isn't *purely* an owner-slot signal) — no fix cycle needed, passed on first review | **yes** |
| 2026-08-03 | `search`'s existing coordinate-scan can evaluate candidates by tournament standing instead of solo `score()` against a scripted bot, without changing the scan mechanics or the non-tournament path | `--tournament-against baseline.json` switches `evaluate()` to `runDuelBrackets` against a fixed baseline; `mode`/`detail` shape distinguishes tournament rows from score rows | 1875→1880 (5 new tests). Verifier independently re-ran `runDuelBrackets` on `search`'s own winning candidate and diffed against `search`'s internal result — byte-identical, proving genuine delegation rather than a look-alike calculation. One cosmetic-only finding (an advisory CLI line unconditionally reworded) | **yes** |
| 2026-08-03 | Swiss pairing (closest-standing pairs, rotated byes, `max(3, ⌈log₂n⌉)` rounds) is the right bounded Tier 5 slice — not an ELO ladder (needs cross-invocation persistence this project has no use for yet) or Odyssey multi-owner (needs the refactor generalized past two slots, out of proportion for a scheduling layer) | `runSwissTournament`, reusing `runSwappedDuel` unchanged as the per-pairing primitive | **Correction below (same date) — this row's own "independently verified" claim was false; see the next row.** A scripting accident in the orchestration crashed before Tier 5 got the same independent verify+review every other tier in this table got; it shipped self-graded (1880→1893, 13 new tests, all green) with nobody else checking it first | **partially — see below** |
| 2026-08-03 | the row above claimed independent verification Tier 5 never actually received — dispatched two fresh, independent agents (a verifier and an adversarial reviewer, same as every other tier) after the fact to check it for real | — | Both found real problems the self-grading missed. **(1) HIGH:** a bye credited `worlds.length × seeds × 2` (a maximum-margin sweep) as pure wins with zero losses — reproduced live tying a candidate that structurally cannot fight (`neverInitiates` + a zero standing-army cap) with a genuine winner, and confirmed that credit exceeded the best real margin observed across every pairing of the project's own 4 named strategies (best real: 7/8; bye credit: 8/8). **(2) MEDIUM:** the pairing algorithm's own comment and CLI text claimed a repeat pairing only happens when "every remaining opponent has already been played" — false: fuzz-tested against a brute-force ground-truth checker, a plain greedy walk (first-fit, no backtracking) produced an *avoidable* repeat in 25-51% of realistic tournaments at n=6..50, and the shipped "rematch avoidance" test only passed because its hardcoded `seedBase` (7) happened to be lucky (6/9/10 reproducibly failed). **(3) low:** the same difficulty-echo bug class fixed elsewhere that day existed twice more, unpatched, in `runSwissBracket`/`runRoundRobinSwapped`'s own bracket-level field | **yes — this is what the row above should have said** |
| 2026-08-03 | fix all three, properly this time: a bye must be worth nothing, and rematch-avoidance must actually hold, not just usually | Bye: removed the wins credit entirely — a bye now adds only to its own `byes` counter, never `wins`/`losses` (renamed `byePoints`→`byeMatchCount`, kept as informational-only). Pairing: `pairRound` now backtracks (`findMatching`, bounded by `MATCH_ATTEMPT_CAP`) to find a genuine zero-repeat matching whenever one exists, falling back to the old greedy pass (which allows repeats) only when none does. Difficulty echo: both remaining instances now read through `pinnedDuelDials` | Fuzz-verified the pairing fix at the exact scales the review found failing (n=4..50, realistic sequential simulation, 990 rounds total): **0 avoidable repeats**, down from the review's measured 25-51%. The bye fix directly closes the reviewer's own repro (a non-fighting candidate can no longer tie a genuine winner). Full suite 1893→1897 (new: a direct backtracking-vs-greedy regression test reproducing the reviewer's exact stranding scenario, a genuine-impossibility fallback test, the bye-neutrality tests, and a strengthened rematch-avoidance test run across 5 seed bases including the ones that broke the old algorithm) | **yes** |
| 2026-08-04 | run the four shipped strategies against EACH OTHER (`duel --candidates`, 6 worlds × 2 seeds × both owner slots) rather than against a scripted bot, and see whether the standings name a defect the solo bench had been averaging away | — (measurement only) | They do, and it agrees with `sweep` from the other direction. Medium: Economic 51W-21L (71%), Force Parity 36-36, Adaptive 32-40, **Aggressive 25W-47L (35%), last**. Hard: Economic 49-23 (68%), Aggressive 37-35, Adaptive 36-36, **Force Parity 22W-50L (31%)**. Economic wins both brackets outright — and on the solo sweep the SAME archetype scores dev 3 under `default` and dev 27 under `economic` (ferros). One cause, visible twice | n/a — this is §2.11's diagnosis |
| 2026-08-04 | the expansion reserve (`ctx.oreReserve`, pinned at a colony ship's cost while units keep spending) is what blocks the industry climb, since `aiIndustry` is gated on it and unit production deliberately isn't | `economist.odyssey.expandWhenNodesBelow: 0` (disable expansion entirely, so the reserve can never pin) | **no — falsified.** ferros/default development moved 3 → 4 and the score went DOWN, 0.419 → 0.360. A plausible mechanism read straight off the code, and wrong; the correlation that suggested it (worse development on the archetypes with greedier `expandWhenNodesBelow`) was confounded | no |
| 2026-08-04 | it is unit production starving everything else: with no standing-army cap, ore never survives to the economy/industry phases, so `industryCount × 2` — the only growing term in the worker-target formula — can never start | `standingArmyCap: 12` on an otherwise-untouched `default`, as a DIAGNOSTIC (one dial, nothing else) | **confirmed.** ferros/default: development 3 → 28, workers 13 → 34, buildings 15 → 64, waves 1 → 11, score 0.419 → 0.850. Capping the army is not the fix — it changes what `default` *is* — but it isolates the mechanism to one sentence, which is what §2.11 then fixes from the income side instead | no (diagnostic only) |
| 2026-08-04 | if income is the real constraint, raising the opening worker crew should fix it without capping anything | `odyssey.workerTarget` × {1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0} across all four archetypes | 4-world sweep (32 runs): baseline 0.593 → **1.5× 0.680**, 2.0× 0.688, 2.5× 0.671; 3.0× never finished — the AI gets big enough that the sim itself slows past a 10-minute budget, which is its own argument against the top of the range. Chose 1.5× (dev-flatline 13/32 → 3/32, the best of the four) | **yes — 1.5×** |
| 2026-08-04 | …and it holds on the full roster, not just the four worlds the search ran on | same 1.5× candidate, 11 worlds × 4 strategies × Medium+Hard × 2 seeds (176 runs) | Mean **0.690 → 0.718**; `dev-flatline` **25/176 → 12/176**, `hostile-but-idle` **9/176 → 3/176**, `hoarding` 9 → 8; `supply-deadlock` 15 → 17 and `production-stall` 63 → 64 (a bigger economy pushes the supply cap harder). 80 configurations improved, 36 unchanged, 60 regressed — every strategy (+0.023 to +0.033) and both difficulties positive on the mean, so not one world carrying it. Note the honest gap: the 4-world subset read +0.088, the full roster +0.028 | **yes** |
| 2026-08-04 | Aggressive's own offense dials can fix its last-place standing | coordinate scan, `armyAttackSizeMult=0.6:1.6` and `garrisonMult=0.4:1.2`, scored by `--tournament-against` Economic | **no.** Best row moved 2W-6L to 3W-5L, at n=8 — noise. Bigger musters did not help at all (0.85/1.35/1.6 all went 1W-7L). Attacking sooner with less was never why it loses | no |
| 2026-08-04 | what Aggressive lacks is what the tournament WINNER has — an economy to follow up with | `aggressive.workerTargetMult`, verified by re-running the whole round-robin, not by the search | **yes, at 1.25 — and the first value tried was a trap.** At **1.4**: Medium 25W-47L → 39W-33L (35% → 54%) but Hard **51% → 44%**, because `aiDifficulty.js`'s Hard row already carries `workerTargetMult: 1.25` and the layers compose multiplicatively (1.4 → 1.75× there). At **1.25** (the value Economic itself carries): Medium 35% → **53%**, Hard 51% → **54%** — both brackets positive. §2.6's unclamped multiplicative layers, showing up as a measured 7-point loss rather than a theoretical risk. The composed product is now pinned by a test | **yes — 1.25** |
| 2026-08-04 | the promoted change must not grow the named defect list | `ailab check`, 44 runs, 60 sim-min, before vs after | **Four of five held or improved, one grew.** `dev-flatline` 10/44 → **5/44**, `hostile-but-idle` 4/44 → **0/44**, `hoarding` 2 → 2, `production-stall` 18 → 17 — and `supply-deadlock` **1/44 → 6/44**. A 60-minute probe of one firing row (`ferros/aggressive`) against both engines shows what grew: 1 Command Center / 20 buildings / 105 supply before, **4 / 169 / 1,248** after, with supply climbing 280→579→807→1,048→1,248 across the run. The AI is living at its ceiling while growing, not stuck — but the detector samples an instant and has no notion of resolution, despite its own `why` claiming it measures "the state that never resolves itself" | shipped with the regression **stated, not hidden** |
| 2026-08-04 | that regression is a real starvation loop — production is supply-blocked, no Habitat is on the way, and unit production has already spent the ore below a Habitat's 75 — so a fourth ore holdback fixes it | `ctx.supplyReserve` in `aiBaseAndTech`, same shape as foundryReserve/refineryReserve/industryReserve, added to `aiProduceAndFortify`'s holdback, Odyssey-only; 3 new tests, one verified to fail without it | **no — rejected on measurement, and reverted.** `check` came back **byte-identical on all five detectors** (supply-deadlock still 6/44). It cannot bind in real play: `aiBaseAndTech` runs before production, so whenever the AI is blocked and can afford a Habitat it founds one in that same phase and the reserve correctly clears — and when it cannot afford 75 it cannot afford a 100-ore Skiff either. The only state where it changes anything is the artificial one its own test had to construct (blocked, with zero workers so the Habitat step is skipped). Dead code in the shipped game | no |
| 2026-08-04 | (open at the time — **answered the next day, see below**) `supply-deadlock` should distinguish "blocked this instant" from "blocked and never resolving" — the same false-positive class §2's methodological note already records twice | — | **not attempted.** Changing a detector changes what every row in this table means, and doing it honestly requires re-baselining the pre-change engine under the new definition (a `git worktree` at the old commit with today's `tools/ailab.js` copied in), exactly as the 2026-07-30 metric-rewrite row did. That is a decision about what the bench measures, so it is left to whoever owns it rather than made by the pass whose own number it would improve | — |
| 2026-08-05 | the `supply-deadlock` regression §2.11 handed back is the DETECTOR, not the AI — and the same flaw should be visible in the other detectors' history | sort all five by the shape of the predicate | **Confirmed, and it explains every rewrite this table records.** The two written as a pure instantaneous fraction (`supply-deadlock`, `production-stall`) are exactly the two that have ever needed rescuing; the three carrying a growth/non-resolution term (`dev-flatline`, `hoarding`, and `hostile-but-idle` since its entitlement gate) have survived two separate scale-ups of the AI untouched | n/a — this is §2.12's diagnosis |
| 2026-08-05 | pair each broken detector's symptom with a non-resolution term, and replace the absolute ore gates with "could it afford the purchase that would have resolved this?" | `supply-deadlock` += `supplyCapGrowthTail <= 0`; `production-stall` += `armyGrowthTail <= 0`; `banked > 400`/`banked > 1000` → `canAffordUnblock`/`canAffordNext` (new `sample()` fields) | Re-baselined properly (a `git worktree` at `7890096` with today's bench copied in, so BOTH columns use one build). Full 2×2 in §2.12. The three untouched detectors reproduce **exactly** across the metric change (2, 10, 4) — the procedure validating itself. `supply-deadlock` is **0/44 on both engines** under the new predicate, so §2.11's 1→6 was entirely the metric. Suite 2056→2061 | **yes** |
| 2026-08-05 | …and the incidental finding, which is the biggest one: `production-stall` 18/44 was never real | — | **`production-stall` is 0/44 on the PRE-FIX engine under the new predicate.** That row has sat in this document since 2026-07-30, was attacked twice (parallel Habitats; then written off as "the Rusher doing what it is designed to do"), and every one of those 18 runs had a growing army in the last third. The AI was never stalled — the detector was counting a Barracks caught between jobs. Two paragraphs of §2 that explained the residue are now marked superseded rather than left standing (the Rusher's "six workers" is nine since §2.11, on top of it) | **yes** |
| 2026-08-05 | a property test can stop a fourth round of this, where three rounds of human scoreboard-reading did not | `test/ailab.test.js`: a synthetic HEALTHY curve, every magnitude scaled 1×/5×/20×/100×, must fire NO detector — plus its converse, that a genuinely stuck curve still fires the right one at 1× and 20× | Verified adversarially rather than assumed: run against the OLD predicates the invariance test fails immediately (`supply-deadlock` fires on the healthy curve even at 1×, blocked 0.33 while the ceiling climbed +72), which is what makes it a real guard rather than one that happens to pass. Both halves needed — invariance alone is satisfiable by a detector that never fires | **yes** |
| 2026-08-05 | (noted, not built) `production-stall`'s new "the army never grew" term would be satisfied by an AI legitimately pinned at a configured Population cap | — | The bench never sets `popCap`, so it cannot arise in `check` today. Recorded in §2.12 as a known boundary rather than discovered later: a future sweep that sets one should exclude those samples the way `armyCapped` already excludes a self-capping strategy | — |
| 2026-08-06 | the three AI dial tables are already a genome — plain data read through `\|\| 1` accessors, so any mutation is a runnable AI rather than a crash — and a population with mutation plus module-wise crossover can search regions a coordinate scan structurally cannot (a valley where two dials must move *together*, which is exactly the shape of this ledger's own 2026-08-04 "Aggressive needs Economic's `workerTargetMult`" result) | `tools/genome.js` (GENOME_SCHEMA: 28 genes over 2 chromosomes and 6 linkage groups, one operator per gene KIND) + `ailab evolve` (Swiss-scheduled duel-Elo fitness, the four shipped baselines as a fixed rating anchor, per-bracket `min` aggregation). Two pre-existing bench bugs fixed to make it measurable: `runDuel` never forwarded a candidate's own archetype to `runDuelMatch` (so every CLI duel gave BOTH seats the world's temperament and silently ignored the candidate files), and `duelSeed` hashes the candidate names (so generated per-individual names drew their own map set each generation) — now an optional `seedKey`, byte-identical when omitted | Suite 2401 → 2433, zero regressions. **Zero files under `engine/` changed** (`git diff --name-only` against the merge base: only `tools/`, `test/`, `docs/`), so `check` is unchanged by construction — confirmed anyway rather than assumed: mean **0.714** over 44 runs, `supply-deadlock`/`hostile-but-idle`/`production-stall` all clean, `hoarding` 2/44 at exactly the `korrath/matching` + `oort/matching` residual the 2026-08-01 row already records, `dev-flatline` 5/44. The defect list did not grow | **yes (tooling)** |
| 2026-08-06 | a 12 × 6 GA on the strategy chromosome finds something the four hand-tuned strategies don't have | 12 genomes × 6 generations, korrath/ferros/vesper, Medium+Hard, 1 seed, 30-min matches (3 h 21 m wall clock) | **Champion is generation 3's `g3i0`; generations 4–6 never beat it.** Stripped of inert genes it is three dials — `neverInitiates: true`, `workerTargetMult: 2` (the schema CEILING, a binding bound), `turretCountMult: 1.05` — with no standing-army cap at all: *max economy, uncapped army, never attack*. Eight of the eleven dials it emits are junk DNA (`attackTimeoutMult`/`armyAttackSizeMult`/`garrisonMult` dead under `neverInitiates` per `aiMilitary.js`'s `readyToAttack` gate; `warFooting*` dead without a `standingArmyCap`; `matchBuffer`/`matchFloor` dead without `matchEnemyForce`) | candidate only — see the two rows below |
| 2026-08-06 | …and it generalises rather than overfitting the three worlds and the 30-minute clock it was selected under | 5-way round-robin on four HELD-OUT worlds (glacius/helix/forge/kybernet), 2 seeds, both brackets, full 40-min matches — 320 matches | **It wins both brackets.** Medium: evolved **50W-14L (78%)**, Economic 36-28, Force Parity 25-39, Aggressive 25-39, Adaptive 24-40. Hard: evolved **40W-24L (63%)**, Aggressive 38-26, Adaptive 37-27, Economic 29-35, Force Parity 16-48. At n=64/bracket, Medium is ~4.5σ over even and unambiguous; Hard's 40-vs-38 lead over Aggressive is a statistical tie, so the honest claim is "clearly best at Medium, joint-best at Hard" | the loop works — **yes** |
| 2026-08-06 | …but is it actually playing better? | same 320 matches, split by `winReason` | **No. It wins on the clock and loses when the clock doesn't save it.** At Hard **all 40 of its wins are `timeout-score`, zero by elimination**, while 16 of its 24 losses ARE eliminations; Medium is 44/50 timeout-score. `engine/victory.js` weights combat units 1.35× and banked ore 0.25×, so an army that never fights — and so never takes attrition — is the highest-scoring thing you can own when the clock runs out. Textbook Goodhart: the objective said "win duels", the shipped tiebreak says a 40-minute duel is won on stockpiled value, so evolution built the biggest stockpile and refused to risk it. Consistent with what this ledger already recorded by hand on 2026-08-04 (Economic, which also never initiates, took 71% at Medium; Aggressive finished last at 35%) — the GA rediscovered that family cold in ONE generation, then pushed it to its limit | **not promoted.** A stronger duel record bought with strictly more boring play is not an improvement to ship |
| 2026-08-06 | how much of the per-generation "improvement" was real? | elitism clones the top 2 genomes unchanged, so generation 3's champion `g3i0` reappears in generation 4 as `g4i0` — identical genes, identical σ | **A free control measurement, and it is damning for the trajectory.** The same genome scored **+199 in generation 3 and +118 in generation 4** — 81 edge points apart. Three functionally identical genomes within generation 4 spanned +163/+134/+118. So the run's tidy +152 → +175 → +199 → +163 → +190 → (+149) is a FLAT LINE with ±80 scatter, not a climb, and at 3 worlds × 1 seed this configuration cannot resolve anything smaller. What survives the noise is only the gap to the anchors (~+120 to +200, every generation) — which the held-out round-robin then confirmed independently. Next run: spend the compute on `--seeds`, or on the successive halving `docs/ai-evolution-design.md` §8.7 describes, rather than on more generations | n/a — methodology |
