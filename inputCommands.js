/* ============================================================
   WHAT A CLICK MEANS — the stateless half of input handling.

   input.js's attachInput was 785 lines in one closure. Most of that length is genuinely
   stateful: drag boxes, pinch gestures, held keys, cycle counters — all mutable, all shared
   between listeners, and none of it separable without inventing a context object that would
   just move the coupling somewhere less obvious.

   These twelve functions are the part that ISN'T. They answer "what is at this point" and
   "what should clicking here do", read only `state` / `camera` / the canvas rect, and touch
   none of that gesture state. Splitting on that line rather than on "mouse vs touch vs
   keyboard" is what makes it a move instead of a rewrite: every listener keeps calling them by
   exactly the same name.

   The payoff is commandAt — 92 lines deciding what a right-click issues (attack / gather /
   build-assist / ferry / repair / set-home / rally / move), previously reachable only by
   constructing a real canvas and dispatching a real MouseEvent. It is now callable directly.

   A factory rather than free functions taking four extra arguments each: the four collaborators
   are fixed for the lifetime of one input controller, so binding them once keeps every call
   site inside attachInput reading exactly as it did.
