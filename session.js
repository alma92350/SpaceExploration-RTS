/* ============================================================
   The live game session — the single mutable holder the UI modules read
   and boot.js reassigns. Before the split these were module-level `let`
   bindings in main.js that every function closed over; now they live on one
   shared object so hud / boot / save / the top-level listeners all see the
   same current game across a "choose another battlefield" restart.

   Read at CALL time (never destructured at module scope), exactly as the old
   closure vars were, so a fresh game swapped in by bootState is picked up by
   every consumer automatically.

  // records the result into the ledger and clears this again, so one finished match can only ever
  // be rated once — and by saveload.js's Home confirm, which has to warn that leaving a live
  // gauntlet match forfeits it. Never part of the sim or the persisted save: like `galaxy`, it
  // says which run this state belongs to, not anything about the state itself.
  competition: null,

  // handler. Kept here, next to supplyBlockedUntil above, for the same reason: it crosses that
  // same module boundary.

  // UI-only comparison state (the engine side only ever knows the CURRENT charge, on the
  // building itself). Keyed by wonder id, not just the charge float, so a Gate razed mid-charge
  // and rebuilt (engine/wonder.js's own header documents that risk) starts its own clean
  // comparison instead of reading as stalled against the dead Gate's final charge. Reset by
  // hud.js's resetPanelSignature() — the same per-boot/per-jump reset the topbar signature

  // history (the exact bug class boot.js's resetWorldUiBookkeeping comment documents for
  // gateMilestone/lastAttackAt).

  // that already fires the transient toast, just remembered here too so starmap.js's
  // renderStarmap can badge a world at a glance instead of relying on whichever toast the player
  // happened to catch. `at` is a performance.now() timestamp; starmap.js treats an attack/hostile
  // entry as "live" only within its own ~30s window, while a "lost" entry persists as a badge
  // until boot.js's focusActivePlanet clears that ONE planet's entry — i.e. until the player
  // actually jumps back and looks. Reset to {} on every fresh boot (bootState), like `groups`
  // below; never part of the deterministic sim or the persisted save (same reasoning as

  // above, not per-unit/per-game state, so collapsing one keeps it collapsed across every later
  // selection until toggled back. A key ABSENT from the set means "expanded" (starts open,
  // unchanged behaviour) — so a new collapsible section needs zero migration code here, it just

  // and `competition` above) and read in three places: boot.js's loop, which drives BOTH seats
  // through tools/selfplay.js's tickSelfPlay instead of the ordinary tick(); observer.js, which
  // lets Observer Mode be entered without an Odyssey when — and only when — this is set (a
  // spectated match is one the human is NOT playing, so revealing its fog is not a cheat); and the
  // spectate UI (observerPanel.js), whose Leave button calls `onLeave` rather than importing
  // competition.js and closing a new module cycle. Never part of the sim or the persisted save —
  // saveShape.js's resumableMode refuses to checkpoint a match this flag marks.
