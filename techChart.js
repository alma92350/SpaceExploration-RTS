/* ============================================================
   The Tech & Industry Chart — a full-screen overlay that finally makes the unlock ladder
   visible in-game (docs/improvement-proposals.md "Tech & Industry Chart overlay"): Foundry ->
   Arsenal, the Datacenter's TECHS -> Chip Fab/Machine Works -> the Strategic tier -> the
   Antimatter Gate. The Odyssey build menu deliberately hides locked buildings to keep the menu
   short (hudSelection.js's GROUPS/alwaysShow comment), the Datacenter panel is a flat list, and
   docs/player-handbook.html — the one place the ladder was drawn — was linked from nowhere in
   the app. This is that missing map: every building, unit gate, and tech/doctrine node laid out
   in TIER COLUMNS (prereq depth, left to right), coloured by live state, so a T2 player can
   literally see the Gate at the end of the road.

   Pure view over BUILDINGS/UNITS/UPGRADES (engine/entities.js) and TECHS (engine/techtree.js) —
   it reads the live game state at open/render time and rebuilds, the same read-only relationship
   starmap.js has with galaxyStatus(). It does not modify engine/ at all.

   A leaf UI module, modeled on starmap.js: its own element, its own pauseLoop('techchart')/
   resumeLoop pair (imported from boot.js exactly like starmap.js does — boot.js itself never
   imports this file, only main.js does, so there's no cycle), and a self-wired topbar button +
   Esc/T hotkey (guarded against firing while a text control is focused, input.js's own pattern).
