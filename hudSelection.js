/* ============================================================
   The HUD SELECTION PANEL — the per-selection button/row subsystem, split out
   of hud.js so neither file is a 1000-line god object. Everything that renders
   for the CURRENT SELECTION lives here: the panel rebuild and its live-patched
   rows/queue, the market / freight / diplomacy / capital sub-panels, the factory
   & rig status lines, the signature guards that keep the rebuild off the per-tick
   hot path, and the small button / tooltip factories.

   renderHUD (hud.js) calls renderSelectionPanel() each HUD tick. The buttons
   here call back into renderHUD() to re-render immediately after an action — a
   benign runtime-only import cycle: the renderHUD binding is used only inside
   click handlers, never at module-evaluation time, so ESM's live bindings resolve
   it fine. The bodies are unchanged from the original hud.js.
