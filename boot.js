   The running game session: startGame (fresh) and bootState (fresh OR loaded)
   wire a state to input, the camera, the fixed-timestep loop and the HUD; the

   the under-attack alert. Split out of main.js — `state`/`input` now live on the

   up automatically (the previous loop is always stopped first).

// same HUD — this IS an ordinary skirmish, it just knows which fixture it belongs to. Nothing about
// the running game changes; only `game.competition` (session.js) is set, which the game-over hook
// below reads to route the result into the ledger.
//
// EVERYTHING IS TAKEN FROM THE FIXTURE, not from the setup screen: the world, the exact seed (off
// the gauntlet's own schedule — never a fresh random one, or a resumed run would replay a different
// map, D6), the pinned difficulty, the opponent's own strategy/archetype, the match length, and
// this fixture's swapAsym parity. The human plays owner "player" with their chosen faction, exactly
// as in a normal skirmish (D4: there is no other seat available to them).

// The three map dials are PINNED, not read off `setup`: a duel's own createSelfPlayState leaves
// sizeMult/resourceMult/popCap at engine defaults, so every rating already in the ladder was earned
// on that map shape. Letting a player's leftover skirmish preferences (Gigantic, Abundant) shape
// the matches that move THEIR rating in the same bracket would make the two numbers incomparable.
//
// BUT PINNING THOSE DOES NOT MAKE A HUMAN MATCH THE SAME SHAPE AS A SIMULATED ONE, and it would be
// dishonest to imply it does. Three differences remain, by construction, and none of them can be
// closed from here:
//   • ONE match, not a worlds x seeds x 2 sweep — a human cannot play forty games (Phase 4's
//     founding constraint), so a human rating rests on far fewer, noisier samples.
//   • NO side-swap, because the human can only ever hold owner "player" (D4). That is the seat the
//     13%-of-think-cycles edge is measured AGAINST, and it is the deviation the UI discloses.
//   • The human HAS a faction and their simulated opponents do not — a self-play match has no
//     faction dial at all (see aiFaction below), so a faction's passive traits appear on exactly
//     one side of a human match and neither side of every other rated match in the bracket.
// The honest framing, and the one the screen states: a human rating is a rating in the SAME table,
// earned under a documented and bounded set of differences — not a number produced by an identical
// process. Do not add a compensating fudge for any of this; see D4 on why a correction nobody can
// derive is worse than a difference everybody can read.

// match rather than a played one is two facts parked on the session afterwards.
//
// 1. THE STATE COMES FROM createSelfPlayState, not createGameState. That is what gives owner
//    "player" a second AI controller (state.playerAi), and it is the SAME constructor
//    tools/duelCore.js's runDuelMatch feeds for every simulated, rated match — so what you watch
//    is configured identically to what the Worker would have run: same world, same derived seed,
//    same swapAsym parity, the same ONE pinned difficulty dial set on both seats, each entrant's
//    own strategy/archetype on its own seat. competition.js's buildWatchConfig shapes that config
//    and is unit-tested against the worker's own seed derivation.
// 2. `game.spectateMatch` then makes the loop below call tickSelfPlay instead of tick (so owner
//    "player" is actually driven), lets Observer Mode be entered without an Odyssey, and marks the
//    match un-checkpointable (saveShape.js's resumableMode).
//
// Observer Mode is entered immediately and deliberately: it is what reveals the fog, gives the
// spectator its own free camera, and — the part that matters most — makes input.js refuse to issue
// a single order (every mouse/wheel/key path already early-returns into observer.js while
// game.observerMode is on). The human watches; they do not play.
//
// EXHIBITION ONLY: nothing here writes to the ledger. `game.competition` stays null, so the
// game-over hook's captureCompetitionResult returns null and no rating moves — see the exhibition
// argument at competition.js's EXHIBITION_NOTE, and the honest game-over copy it feeds.
