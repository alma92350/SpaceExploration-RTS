/* ============================================================
   THE SELECTION PANEL'S DERIVED STATE — everything hudSelection.js reads OUT of
   the game state, with nothing that builds DOM.

   The dividing line is exactly that: derive here, render there. It falls out of
   what panelSignature is. That function is the panel's entire reactivity model —
   it decides whether renderSelectionPanel rebuilds AT ALL, so a panel whose own
   state contributes no term to it silently never redraws. (That is not
   hypothetical: it is what left the Freight Lane and Colony Policy controls
   inert, reading as no-ops and inviting a second click that toggled the change
   back.) A model that important should be readable on its own, without scrolling
   past 800 lines of button construction — and the derivations it shares with the
   renderers (factoryStatus, loadableComs, countByType, counterInfo) belong beside
   it rather than in the middle of the DOM code, since both sides call them and
   the two must never drift.

   This module imports no DOM and no hud.js, so unlike the panel itself it is a
   genuine leaf: importable and drivable directly from a test, and outside the
   hud/hudSelection import cycle entirely.

   The long-term shape is a registry of { match, signature, render } per panel
   family, co-locating each panel's signature term with the panel that draws it
   (docs/code-improvement-tiers.md, Tier 3). This split is the seam that makes
   that a move rather than a rewrite; test/hudSelection.test.js already drives a
   completeness table over every interactive panel family so a missing term fails
   loudly instead of shipping dead.
