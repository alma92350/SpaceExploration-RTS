/* ============================================================
   AI LAB — a headless bench for the Odyssey opponent, so "is this AI any good?"
   becomes a measurement instead of an opinion.

   The engine test suite already guards INVARIANTS (determinism, purity, "a skirmish
   resolves to a winner"). Nothing measures QUALITY: whether the neighbour on an
   Odyssey world develops, spends what it earns, and applies pressure in proportion to
   how hostile it has become. Those are curves over 30–60 minutes of sim, not
   assertions, and they're exactly what breaks silently when an archetype number moves.

   This tool runs the sim headlessly (it's already pure and deterministic — that's the
   whole reason this is cheap), samples an AI-quality metric set on a fixed cadence, and
   prints a scoreboard. Because the AI's whole behaviour space is three plain-data
   tables — ARCHETYPES × STRATEGIES × DIFFICULTY_OPTIONS, all read through defensive
   `|| 1` accessors — a candidate strategy is a JSON object, not a code change: pass
   --overrides and the lab writes new rows into those tables before it runs. So
   searching for a better AI needs no engine edit at all.

   Usage
     node tools/ailab.js probe   [--world ferros] [--strategy default] [--difficulty medium]
                                 [--opponent passive] [--minutes 40] [--sample 5]

                                 [--tournament-against baseline.json]
                                 # default objective: solo score() against the --opponent sparring
                                 # bot, same as always. --tournament-against swaps ONLY the
                                 # objective a candidate dial-value is scored by, onto Tier 2/3's
                                 # fair, side-swapped, difficulty-bracketed self-play duel
                                 # (runDuelBrackets) against the named baseline candidate JSON
                                 # ({ name, strategy, overrides }) — the coordinate-scan mechanics
                                 # (the per-dial, per-step loop, "keep an improvement") are
                                 # unchanged and don't know which objective is active.
     node tools/ailab.js check   [--worlds a,b] [--minutes 60] [--exit-code]   # the named-defect list
     node tools/ailab.js duel    --a candA.json --b candB.json [--worlds a,b] [--seeds 2]
                                 [--difficulties easy,hard] [--seed 1] [--minutes 40] [--json out.json]
                                 # Tier 3: side-swapped (both candidates play BOTH owner slots, by
                                 # DEFAULT, not an opt-in) and difficulty-bracketed (each --difficulties
                                 # entry reported on its own, never blended) — see the DUEL header
                                 # comment below.

   Opponents (--opponent) decide what the AI is measured AGAINST, and the answer differs
   completely between them: none (no player at all) · passive (seats a base, never acts — the
   only bot that never draws blood) · turtle (economy behind turrets, never attacks) · skirmisher
   (a turtle that also attacks with whatever it has mustered) · tech (a turtle that ALSO climbs
   Foundry -> Arsenal and attacks with a Lancer/Breacher/Dreadnought guard instead of a Skiff blob
   — the counter-pick/composition yardstick: does the AI react to and survive an actual army, not
   just a blob). skirmisher and tech are the two that provoke.

   Common flags
     --overrides f.json   inject rows into the AI tables before running, e.g.
                          { "strategies": { "swarm": { "armyAttackSizeMult": 0.5 } },
                            "archetypes": { "rusher": { "odyssey": { "workerTarget": 9 } } },
                            "difficulties": { "hard": { "workerTargetMult": 1.4 } } }
     --seed N             base seed (default 1) — every run is reproducible from it
     --apm real|none      default 'real': the AI runs at its OWN difficulty row's aiApm cap
                          (engine/aiDifficulty.js) — the single biggest difficulty dial, and until
                          now exercised by zero bench measurements. 'none' keeps a run unthrottled,
                          for comparison against the bench's pre-APM measurement history.

   Deterministic by construction: every world seeds from mulberry32, every sparring
   opponent is scripted off the sim clock, and no wall-clock or Math.random is read. Two
   runs of the same command produce byte-identical numbers.

   Lives in tools/ (a dev bench, like tools/serve.js) — NOT in engine/, which stays the
   pure shipped simulation. It only ever READS the engine's public API.

   LEADERBOARD — Tier 0 of "which strategy is actually better": rank candidates against a
   FIXED, non-adaptive sparring bot with every other dial held equal, no engine change needed.

   This is NOT head-to-head play. Nothing here makes two candidates fight each other — that
   needs runAI to drive two independently-configured owners in the same match, which it can't
   do yet (docs/odyssey-ai-review.md §2.8, "There is no AI-vs-AI, but there nearly is"). What

   them by the same score() this bench already uses for solo tuning. "Candidate A beats candidate
   B" here means "A scored higher against the same yardstick B faced", which is real signal but a
   PROXY for competitive self-play, not a substitute for it — say so wherever this is reported.

   A candidate is { name, strategy, overrides }: `strategy` (default "default") is which

   DUEL — Tier 2: true head-to-head, not a proxy. Two independently-configured
   candidates fight each other for real, via Tier 1's self-play (tools/selfplay.js):
   BOTH sides driven by the real scripted AI (engine/ai.js runAI), never a scripted
   sparring bot (contrast the LEADERBOARD above, which is exactly that proxy). Skirmish
   only — createSelfPlayState's default (non-endless) shape — resolved purely by engine/
   victory.js's own checkWinCondition (elimination, or its score-at-clock timeout),
   exactly as any other skirmish resolves. No new win condition is invented here.

   FAIRNESS, the one property this command cannot be trusted without: difficulty — and
   therefore APM and micro, both DERIVED from the difficulty row (engine/aiDifficulty.js
   DIFFICULTY_OPTIONS: aiApm/aiMicro) — is pinned IDENTICAL for both sides. That isn't a
   convention the caller has to remember: pinnedDuelDials() (tools/duelCore.js) reads the
   difficulty ONCE into a single `dials` object, and duelRun() (tools/duelCore.js's
   runDuelMatch, imported below under this file's own long-standing local name) spreads
   that SAME object into both createSelfPlayState `ai` and `playerAi` configs. There is
   only one variable in the whole call graph that could ever hold "this side's
   apm/micro/difficulty" — so there is no second code path left that could read a
   different value for either side, even by mistake. Only `strategy` (and whatever
   --overrides row it names) differs between the two candidates — that is the entire
   point of the comparison.

   Candidate A always plays owner "player", candidate B always plays owner "ai" — a fixed,
   documented mapping. That is NOT enough on its own: some worlds (oort, nimbus — both
   reachable via --worlds) carry engine/map.js's `asym: { player, ai }` modifier block, a
   genuinely asymmetric per-owner stat tweak baked into the map, independent of which
   candidate is playing which owner. A fixed candidate->owner mapping would hand that
   map-side advantage to the same candidate on every single match — measured empirically at
   ~6/0 (oort) and ~5/6-inverted (nimbus) for two IDENTICAL candidates, i.e. the map side
   deciding the match, not candidate quality. So runDuel alternates the engine's own escape
   hatch for this (`swapAsym`, the same flag the skirmish game exposes so a human can choose
   which half to play) by replicate parity — even reps (0, 2, …) play the map as generated,
   odd reps play it with the asym halves exchanged — so across any run of seeds >= 2 on an
   asym world, each candidate spends half its matches on each side of the map's own
   asymmetry and neither one's map-side is fixed for the whole run. `swapAsym` is a no-op on
   every world without an asym block, so this changes nothing for the default roster
   (korrath/ferros/vesper/kybernet). Each row records the `swapAsym` it actually ran with.

   SCORING: winner/loser/draw comes straight from engine/victory.js's own state.winner/
   state.over — elimination or its score-at-clock tiebreak, never reinterpreted here (a
   "draw" here means only that the run hit its safety-net cutoff still undecided, which
   the tiebreak means should not happen in practice). The "score margin" reported
   alongside it is exactly the score that tiebreak itself uses — engine/victory.js
   playerScore/scoreBreakdown (bank + army + structures) — NOT this file's own score()/
   WEIGHTS system above. That system scores an ODYSSEY play-forever curve: `develop` and
   `keepGrowing` key off aiDevelopment(state), which engine/diplomacy.js's own header
   comment says plainly is hardcoded to owner "ai" and that "the whole skirmish path...
   never calls this"; `pressure`/`hostileIdleFrac` key off hostility()/provoked(), which
   need state.diplomacy — absent from every skirmish state, self-play included. Forcing
   that curve-shaped, Odyssey-specific metric onto a skirmish fight it was never built to
   describe would produce numbers that LOOK like this file's score() but don't mean the
   same thing. Reusing playerScore instead keeps "score" meaning exactly what it already
   means everywhere self-play/skirmish resolution is concerned: the real number the match
   itself would settle a tie with.

// snapshotTables/restoreTables this file already uses.
//
// A and B must have DIFFERENT names, same reasoning as assertUniqueCandidateNames below (which

// user a clear, immediate reason instead of a duel that runs to completion and THEN throws).
// `archetype` (docs/competitions-and-elo.md D3) is a per-candidate field tools/duelCore.js's
// runDuelMatch has always accepted and competitionWorker.js has always passed, but which this
// function never forwarded — so a CLI duel had both seats playing whatever temperament the WORLD

// in-game. Forwarded now (absent/undefined on every hand-written candidate file, and runDuelMatch
// treats absent as byte-identical to omitting it — test/duelCore.test.js pins that), which is what
// lets an evolved genome carry a macro/tempo/composition chromosome and not just a strategy row.

/* ============================================================
   TIER 3 — a candidate compared against remembered numbers is a candidate compared against
   nothing (docs/odyssey-ai-review.md §3, the ai-lab skill's standing lesson). runDuel above is
   already a fair SINGLE match-up: one map-side assignment (A="player", B="ai"), one difficulty.
   Tier 3 wraps it with the two things a noisy objective needs before a verdict means anything:

   1. SIDE-SWAP, on by DEFAULT (not a flag to remember). runDuel's own header comment already
      names why: "the two owner slots are not perfectly symmetric, different starting corner,
      different fog seed stream" — map-side asym (oort/nimbus) is the mechanical example
      runDuel already documents and corrects for WITHIN one direction (swapAsym by replicate
      parity), but that only balances the map; it says nothing about whether the "ai" owner
      slot itself is a structurally easier seat to play (a different think-cadence phase
      offset, a different fog stream, in principle even an unnoticed engine asymmetry between
      the two owner code paths). The only way to rule that out is to literally run the pairing
      both ways — A as "ai"/B as "player", THEN B as "ai"/A as "player" — and look at both
      halves, not just their sum. runSwappedDuel below returns `aAsAi` and `bAsAi` as two full,
      independently-inspectable sub-results (not just labelled rows folded into one number) for
      exactly that reason: a side-symmetry bug would show up as those two disagreeing, and
      collapsing them into a single aggregate is precisely what would hide it.
   2. DIFFICULTY as a swept, NEVER-BLENDED axis. runDuelBrackets below takes a LIST of
      difficulties and runs the full side-swapped pairing separately at each one, returning one

   TIER 5 — SWISS PAIRING: a schedule that scales in ROUNDS, not in candidates squared, for
   candidate pools too large for runRoundRobinSwapped's full round-robin to stay cheap.

   Every pairing above (leaderboard, duel, round-robin) is trustworthy because it's built on
   runSwappedDuel — side-swapped, difficulty-bracketed, APM/micro pinned identical for both
   sides. Round-robin's only weakness is its SCHEDULE: C(n,2) pairings, so a pool of 20
   candidates is already 190 pairings, each `worlds x seeds x 2 sides` matches — the quadratic
   cost the Tier 5 stretch goal in the roadmap named directly. Swiss pairing is the standard
   answer (chess/Magic tournament scheduling): each round pairs candidates with the CLOSEST
   current standing instead of every candidate meeting every other one, so after
   `rounds` = O(log2 n) rounds the ranking has converged without ever running the full
   quadratic schedule. This file changes NOTHING about what a "fair fight" means — every
   pairing below is still exactly one runSwappedDuel call, same fairness guarantees, same
   opts shape as runDuel/runRoundRobinSwapped. Tier 5 is a new SCHEDULE on top of a trusted
   primitive, not a new way of deciding who won a match.

   THE PAIRING RULE ITSELF NOW LIVES IN ../pairing.js — moved there whole, comments included
   (docs/competitions-and-elo.md Phase 3), so the in-game competition screen schedules a tournament
   through this exact code instead of a second copy of it. Its header carries the two paragraphs
   that used to sit here: PAIRING RULE (why findMatching backtracks rather than walking greedily —
   independent review measured avoidable repeats in a quarter to half of realistic tournaments with
   the greedy version) and BYES (why a bye adds to nobody's wins/losses, which the first cut got
   wrong). Read them there before changing any of it. rankStandings/pairRound/buildSwissBracket are
   re-exported below under their original names, so every caller here — and every test — is
   unchanged.

   ROUNDS: default `Math.max(3, Math.ceil(Math.log2(candidates.length)))` — the textbook rule
   of thumb for how many Swiss rounds separate a field of that size — override with `--rounds`.
   Like runDuelBrackets/runRoundRobinSwapped, `--difficulties` (plural) runs the WHOLE Swiss
   schedule again per difficulty, each one its own independent tournament (own pairings, own
   standings) — never blended, for the identical reason those two keep brackets separate.
   ============================================================ */

// pairKey, MATCH_ATTEMPT_CAP, findMatching, greedyMatching, rankStandings, pairRound and
// buildSwissBracket were all declared right here until Phase 3 moved them — whole, comments

// this file has always exported are re-exported from there under the same names, so

   EVOLUTION — a population of genomes, selected by real self-play (docs/ai-evolution-design.md)

   `search` above is a coordinate scan: it moves ONE dial at a time and greedily keeps whatever
   improved. That is the cheapest thing that works, and it has a structural blind spot — it cannot
   cross a valley where two dials must move TOGETHER. This codebase has the worked example already
   written down: engine/aiStrategy.js records that Aggressive finished last of four in self-play,
   that a coordinate scan over its own offense dials could not fix it, and that what fixed it was
   an ECONOMY dial (workerTargetMult) borrowed from another strategy. A scan structurally cannot
   find that; a population with mutation and crossover finds it by construction.

   So this is the same "candidate vs a yardstick" shape the rest of the file has, with three
   differences: candidates are generated rather than hand-written (tools/genome.js), there are many
   of them at once, and the yardstick includes each other.

   WHAT MAKES THE FITNESS TRUSTWORTHY, since that is the only part that decides whether any of this
   is real:

     • It is DUEL Elo, not score(). score()'s six weights are a hand-written definition of "better
       AI", and a population is a machine for exploiting hand-written definitions — `thrift` pays
       for ending poor (a genome that dumps ore into junk turrets farms it), `pressure` counts
       waves (a genome that trickles one unit at a time farms it). A win cannot be farmed except by
       winning. score() stays available as a DIAGNOSTIC via `sweep`, never as the objective here.
     • It is SWISS-scheduled, so a generation costs O(n log n) pairings instead of round-robin's
       C(n,2) — the difference between a generation taking minutes and taking an hour, which is
       the difference between running this and not.
     • The four shipped baselines ride along as a HALL OF FAME. A population evolving only against
       itself can drift in a cycle forever (rusher beats greedy beats turtle beats rusher) with no
       absolute progress — the Red Queen. Elo measured partly against a fixed anchor is absolute.
       tools/candidates/baseline-*.json already exist and are exactly that anchor.
     • Every bracket in `--difficulties` is rated SEPARATELY and then aggregated by the WORST of
       them by default (`--agg min`). engine/aiStrategy.js has the cautionary row for this too: a
       workerTargetMult of 1.4 wins Medium harder and LOSES Hard, because Hard's own row already
       carries 1.25 and the layers compose multiplicatively. A genome scored on one difficulty is
       not scored.
     • Every pairing in the whole run shares ONE seedKey (tools/duelCore.js duelSeed), so every
       genome ever evaluated in round R faced the identical maps. Without it, each generation's
       generated names hash to their own map set and "the child beat its parent's number" is partly
       a statement about map luck. The cost of pinning is that the run can overfit that map set,
       which is what `--holdout-worlds` is for: validate the champion on worlds it never trained on
       and report both numbers.

   HEALTH CHECKS — the findings this bench already turned up, encoded

   Each is a named, reproducible defect rather than a paragraph in a review doc: run the
   check, get the list of worlds it fires on. Fix the AI and the list shrinks. These are
   REPORTED, not asserted — the tool's job is to measure, and today several of them fire.

   THE DESIGN RULE, learned the expensive way (three rewrites across 2026-07-30 and
   2026-08-05, docs/odyssey-ai-review.md §2.12). Sort these five by the SHAPE of the
   predicate and the whole history explains itself:

     • carries a "…and it never resolved" term  — dev-flatline (devGrowthTail), hoarding
       (armyGrowthTail). Both survived two separate scale-ups of the AI untouched.
     • pure instantaneous fraction               — supply-deadlock, production-stall. Both
       became false positives the moment the AI got bigger, because "is this true right
       now, often enough?" is a question whose answer drifts with scale.

   So every detector here must now be BOTH halves: a symptom (a fraction of samples) AND a
   non-resolution term proving the symptom never cleared. A busy AI is momentarily blocked,
   momentarily idle, and momentarily rich all the time; only a stuck one is still in that
   state with nothing having moved. The absolute ore thresholds went the same way — a gate
   of "banked > 1000" is a statement about one particular size of economy, so both are now
   asked as "could it afford the exact purchase that would have resolved this?" (sample()'s
   canAffordUnblock / canAffordNext), which has no scale in it at all.

   test/ailab.test.js pins this as a property rather than a set of cases: a synthetic
   HEALTHY curve, scaled from 1x to 100x, must fire nothing. That is the guard that stops a fourth
   round of this.

/* ============================================================
   SEARCH — a deterministic coordinate scan over a strategy's numeric dials, keeping an
   improvement. Deliberately the simplest thing that works; the interesting judgement is which
   dials to open, and that stays the caller's.

   Two OBJECTIVES an evaluate() step can score a candidate dial-value by, selected once up front
   and never mixed mid-run:
     - default: solo score() against the --opponent scripted sparring bot (unchanged from before
       this file grew a second mode — same runMatrix/score call, same seed derivation).
     - --tournament-against baseline.json: Tier 2/3's fair, side-swapped, difficulty-bracketed
       self-play duel (runDuelBrackets) against a FIXED baseline candidate, standing measured as
       win differential (aWins - bWins) / n across every bracket combined. This is the same
       "candidate vs a fixed yardstick" shape score()-mode already has — just the yardstick is a
       real opponent playing the real AI, not a scripted bot's solitaire curve.

   The coordinate-scan mechanics below (the per-dial, per-step loop, "keep an improvement if it
   beats the current best") are IDENTICAL in both modes and don't know which objective is active
   — only evaluate()'s own body differs. Returns a plain result object (not console output) so
   both the CLI and a test can read it directly.

                              than drifting in a Red Queen cycle, and every difficulty bracket is
                              rated separately then aggregated by the WORST of them (--agg min) --
                              see the EVOLUTION header comment for both arguments. Writes the
                              champion as a runnable candidate file, so it goes straight back into
                              duel/sweep/leaderboard. Odyssey-gated genes (diplomacy, industry) are
                              EXCLUDED by default: a duel is a skirmish, so nothing there reads
                              them and evolving them would be scoring pure drift.
