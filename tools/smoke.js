/* ============================================================
   BROWSER SMOKE TEST — does the game actually run in a browser?

   WHY THIS EXISTS, given 2500 passing tests.

   There is no build step: the files in the repo are the files the browser loads. That is the
   project's best property and its sharpest edge. `node --test` runs the engine headlessly and
   test/static-integrity.test.js catches STATIC breakage — a syntax error, an import pointing at a
   moved file, a `getElementById` for an id that does not exist. Neither can catch a page that
   parses perfectly, imports cleanly, and then throws on load. That failure mode is a blank white
   screen, and the way it has been found here before is a human opening the page and clicking.

   This closes that gap: boot the real page in real Chromium, start a real match, click things,
   and fail on any uncaught error. It is deliberately shallow — it asserts the game RUNS, not that
   it is correct. Correctness is the unit suite's job, and it is much better at it.

   WHY IT IS NOT PART OF `npm test`. Driving a browser needs Playwright, and this project ships
   with no dependencies and no build step. Two things keep that promise intact:

     - It lives in tools/, so `node --test test/*.test.js` never globs it. `npm test` stays
       offline, dependency-free and fast.
     - Playwright is installed with `--no-save`, so it never enters package.json. Same intent as
       the CI type-check step fetching TypeScript on demand: a tool the build uses is not a thing
       the game depends on. (`npx --package X -- node script` looks like the tidier version of
       this and does NOT work — npx puts the package's BIN on PATH but not its module on the
       child's resolution path, so `require` inside the script still fails. Verified, after
       shipping it broken once.)

   RUNNING IT

     npm install --no-save playwright@1.56.1   # once; --no-save keeps package.json clean
     npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
     npm run smoke
     npm run smoke -- --keep-open              # headed, left open, to watch it

   It starts and stops its own server, so there is nothing to set up. Exits non-zero on the first
   uncaught page error, on a console error, or on any step not reaching the state it expects.

       Six sub-screens rendered straight into the DOM by competition.js, none of which the match
       walkthrough below ever touches. Worth its own steps because of the exact failure mode this
       whole file exists for: the AI Editor shipped reaching for an undefined `STRATEGIES` binding,
       which parses fine, imports fine, and throws only when a human clicks the tab. refreshCompView
       empties its wrapper BEFORE calling the screen renderer, so the throw left a pane holding
       nothing but the back button and the tab row — a blank screen and a console error nobody saw.

       Each tab is checked against the ERROR LOG rather than against a child count, and that is the
       substantive choice here. A half-rendered screen still has children: the AI Editor appends its
       intro paragraph before the line that threw, so "more children than the chrome" passed on the
       very bug this is meant to catch. A tab that raised nothing is the real assertion, and it says
